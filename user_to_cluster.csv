94,"I would say this place was just ok. The decor and atmosphere is similar to most other places in leavenworth - ""cozy"", meaning outdated furniture, small places, and decor like grandmas house. I don't by any means mean that in a bad or negative way but it's just part of the ambiance or leavenworth vibe, i think. The service was pretty quick for how busy they were, but the food was just ok. I found the prices to be a little steep for what it was, but again I feel like that is typical for a small tourist town. You can kind of get away with charging a lot of money for food that is just ok. Nothing terrible to to say about the food, it just wasn't anything to write home about and we were both disappointed that the menu clearly stated each meal came with a dinner roll or for $3 you can upgrade to garlic bread. No said dinner roll ever came with either of our meals and it was actually a little surprising as most italian restaurants you get either a small basket of bread with butter or oil/vinegar. No such thing here and the one they promise you with the meal doesn't come either.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
96,"Service on my phone was struggling in leavenworth, but had I been able to load yelp, I would've known better than to come here for breakfast. The place is downstairs in a windowless, cramped basement for one. Not the most inviting place, but if the food and service are good then it doesn't matter. Unfortunately that's not the case. We paid close to $15 a plate for probably the worst breakfast I've ever had and in my opinion breakfast (at least a basic breakfast) is a very hard thing to mess up - eggs, bacon, sausage are all very easy things to make with little to no skills. I should open a cafe cause the breakfast I make at home was definitely better than this. One, I felt bad for the staff. There were 2 girls working the entire restaurant, and while it's not huge it was a weekend and there don't seem to be a lot of options in leavenworth so everyone is looking for somewhere to eat. It took a while for them to take orders and there were several other tables that were complaining that the waitress must've just forgotten them. They definitely needed more than 2 girls in there (especially when one was also the bartender/barista). Two, the food was terrible. There's no nicer way to say it. I don't know what the eggs were.. but it did not seem as though they were fresh eggs.. almost like they were frozen egg patties that they diced up. They were also brown and burnt. How does one mess up scrambled eggs? I don't understand. The biscuit and gravy was bland. The biscuit was doughy instead of flaky and there was not a good proportion of gravy. The sausage patty I had one sliver of and didn't touch after that. It was like someone dipped it in grease. The bacon was honestly the only thing palatable. You also go up to the counter to pay after you eat, which isn't made apparent what-so-ever but we figured it out after the table next to us complained to the waitress that they'd been waiting to get the check cause they had other things to do and the waitress was like oh you just go up to the counter and pay - which is also awkward because there is no place to really stand so you're all up in everyones space as they're eating their breakfast. Anyway, when we did finally go up to pay we stood around for at least 5-10 mins until they had time to cash us out. You're honestly better off buying a pastry or going to get mcdonalds and I don't say that to be mean but I just don't think it's right to charge $15 a plate for food that is almost inedible and service that is equally as bad.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
102,"Was looking forward to trying this place after seeing a little ad for it in one of the books at our hotel - the food looked good and the space looked cute and trendy.I expected this to be a full service restaurant just by the looks of the ad we saw, but it's not that. You order at a counter, take a number to your table and they bring your food to your table. I should've known it would be sub-par after we got to the counter to order and the guy literally took 10 minutes to take our order, i kid you not. We ordered 4 tacos and a side of refried beans in case you're wondering. While yes, one of us asked for no tomatos, no onions and sauce on the side - we didn't think that would take 10 minutes to key into the computer. It seemed like their ordering system did not have buttons for ""no this or that"" as the guy seemed to be manually typing out sentences. Further more as we were paying and it printed back to the open kitchen which is right next to the register - the cooks were confused and the guy had to further explain to them what we didn't want on 2 of the tacos. The tacos were brought to our table but not our beans, so we mentioned we also had beans and the waitress replied ""oh yeah we know, those are coming""... 15 minutes later, we were already done with our tacos when she brought out the beans. Seriously? isn't that restaurant 101 that unless it's an app or it's requested that it comes out at a diff time that you bring all the food out at the same time. Seriously, bizarre. Also, the side of beans were the size of what a small dipping saucer of salsa would go in so i don't understand how they took 15 minutes to cook. Also, the bar didn't open til 3 or 4, which you also have to order from separately. Overall, odd experience.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
105,"Maybe it's downtown vancouver in general, but this place is bougie AF. It's full of 20-somethings who are there to see and be seen ordering their bottles of dom perignon. If that's the vibe you're looking for you'll love this place. We made a reservation and as we walked and and told the hostess there were 2 of us and before we could get out that we had reservations, she looked us up and down and said they didn't have any tables, to which we responded, oh no we have reservations :)it took our waitress a while to come by, and after we ordered drinks they took a really long time to get there. I ended up getting the spaghetti and it was actually really good and the serving was huge - but I would expect it to be since it was over $30. While the food was good, the prices were high and the clientele were your typical flashy rich kids - which seems to be a rampant thing in vancouver.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
107,"Took our money elsewhere. We arrived here with high expectations as I've read it's one of the must-go-to wineries when visiting here. When we arrived the tasting room was jam packed. I expected it to be more touristy and whatnot since it is a bigger facility, so it's not like I was exactly expecting more personal service that you get at the smaller wineries, but I also was not expecting to loiter around for 15 minutes waiting for a spot anywhere to open up. Nada. I think what disappointed me the most was that employees took zero notice. I've wine tasted in other large facilities in places like Napa and Sonoma where the feel is similar as it is a much larger production place - but no where have I stood around looking like an idiot for 15 minutes without being offered anything or without and employee trying to make room somewhere. So we eventually left and took our money down to the hatch next door where the staff were much more friendly and accommodating!",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
108,"We came here on a weekend night without reservations, which we quickly learned in kelowna is a mistake to begin with as every place was packed to the gills with long wait times. We waited it out.. they had just seated a bunch of tables so unfortunately none of the tables were turned and when they were finally ready to seat us about 5 tables all opened up at once.. go figure. The hostess was very nice though and did a good job keeping us informed and trying to find options for us a the bar.After we were seated, it then took a while for the waitress to even come by. The menu isn't too extensive, so I went with the shrimp risotto and my boyfriend did the buttermilk chicken. It took quite a while for the food to come out - the risotto was just ok and my boyfriend said the same about the chicken except that the serving size on his was actually quite small. There were a couple of chunks of chicken but after pulling it apart he found that it was almost all breading... there were a couple of little chunks of waldorf salad as more of a decoration around the plate, so needless to say he left here very hungry which I find to be pretty unacceptable when you're paying over $20 for a plate. The original reason I knew about this place was because I heard of their hip hop brunch which I really wanted to try.. but unfortunately they don't even open until 10:30 which seems late for me. Yes, I get that it's brunch, but also a lot of people wake up and would like to hit the breakfast side of brunch and I think they're missing out of a big crowd there. I'm up at 8 or 9 usually, so to wait around til 10:30 to eat breakfast isn't going to happen. Overall, not impressed with this place for the price.. but seems to have stellar reviews, so maybe my standards are just too high.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
113,"Came in just as breakfast service had ended, otherwise I would've had some breakfast but was stuck having lunch instead. Not much is open in Winthrop earlier than about 11, so options in the area are slim to begin with.The service was fine, but the review here is mainly on the food which is mediocre at best. It's your standard burgers, sandwiches, salads, soups kind of place. So I opted for the chicken strips and it was like eating cafeteria food. The chicken had a lot of stringy fat in it that I had to keep spitting out. Not worth the price, I'd do some more googling and try to land somewhere else if you have the chance.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
116,"I didn't have any coffee here, so I can't rate the beverages but overall unimpressed and felt like yelp failed me a little on this one. I think potentially the reason this place is so busy and has so many reviews is because it's pretty much the only thing opened early in winthrop - so if you're trying to hit the road early or have breakfast, this is pretty much your only options.That was exactly what I was trying to do as we were trying to hit the road early to get home from labor day. It was 8am so this place had been open for an hour at that point and the line was pretty much out the door. I wasn't trying to sit in and eat, just grab a sandwich and possibly a pastry to go. As I get up the case, I notice that the pastry selection is a little slim. The cinnamon rolls look good though. Then I get a little closer and see a sign for breakfast sandwiches and think oh good I'll get that instead. I get up to the counter and notice that the hot case that probably holds the sandwiches are empty so I ask the girl what's left or how long they take to make and she annoyingly sighs and shakes her head that they don't have any left as if I should've known this as she removes the large sign sitting on top of the pasty case advertising the sandwiches and also adds that they aren't making anymore. Sorry, but I think it's a little silly that the place hasn't even been opened for an hour and they're out of breakfast sandwiches on a holiday weekend? Whatever though, their loss of business. I opted for a cinnamon roll to go. I wasn't given a plastic fork and all that was available at the condiment/coffee counter was metal soooo guess I was gonna eat this thing with my hands in the car. The icing was good but that was about it. The roll itself was undercooked once you got towards the bottom. I like cookies slightly undercooked but I'm not one for under cooked bread dough. Maybe it was an off day, or maybe coming from seattle where bakeries and coffee shops are rampant makes my standards too high.. but really don't understand the stellar reviews on this one.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
135,"From what I take, it's supposed to be like the ""fancy"" restaurant in Ocean Shores. Coming from Seattle though, I was very confused about the vibe here.. I sort of get it because I'm originally from a small town and know what it's like to have no restaurant options so I tried to keep an open mind. The outside looks like any other building in Ocean Shores, but the inside decor here is actually pretty nice and fits that of a nice restaurant. When we were there, there was a couple decked out to the nines - full suit on the guy and fancy dress and high heels on the girl and sitting next to them was a family with 2 screaming children that had crayons... sooo that's what I mean about confusing vibe. We sat in the bar and it took a solid 10 minutes for the bartender to come over and give us menus. There was no one else in the bar. The prices here fit that of a fancy steak restaurant and just knowing how that normally goes in a small town, I stuck with a standard burger and fries while my boyfriend rolled the dice and went with a steak and baked potato. My burger was just fine, but my boyfriends steak was way over cooked even though he asked for it medium. His baked potato also had onions in it after he specifically asked for it to come plain. We had waited a while for the food though so didn't bother sending it back. In the time we were there we witnessed two issues though. There was one at the table behind us.. we aren't exactly sure what the issue was because we didn't start evesdropping soon enough but the lady at the table was not happy and the bartender was apologizing profusely. We assumed it had something to do with the food because the lady told the bartender not to be sorry because it was the kitchen's fault and not his. Then we witnessed/heard a fight going on between workers in the kitchen. Two cooks screaming at each other about getting in each others way. Screaming. It happens.. but pretty unprofessional.Overall, this place isn't worth the money. Just don't come to Ocean Shores thinking you're going to have a nice fancy meal.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
141,"The location was a little hard to find if coming in from the street side as it's tucked away in the back of the Royal Hawaiian, but it is at a nice spot right on the beach, similar to Dukes. We happened to come on the night that they do the fireworks show on the beach, which was a nice surprise but that's about all that was enjoyable about this place. There was also some show going on for a conference on a stage right next to the bar area, so you couldn't hear anything. Service was extremely slow. We also made the mistake of thinking we'd grab dinner here and not checking the menu online before hand. Extremely limited food menu... fish and chips were about the only thing on there and you're going to pay close to $20 for a little plate. Drinks were over priced as well. This was all disappointing considering it's in the Royal Hawaiian hotel, so I suppose we just expected better. Skip it and walk a little down the beach to Dukes or something.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
147,"I've rented a car several times in many other places before and simply was not prepared at how busy and unprepared this location would be... had I read the reviews here first, I may've known that as it seems not the be an isolated incident, but just how this place functions. Slow. With zero sense of urgency. They are on Hawaii time for sure. When we arrived we were maybe #3 in line, but then we noticed there was only 2 ladies working -- and one of those was working the fast break line... so they had one attendant for all the regular customers. Took us almost an hour and a half to get all squared away here. There are also a couple nuances of renting here that i don't remember dealing with renting from other locations. One of which was that the main driver had to be the one paying - this created a hassle as my BF is typically the main driver, but this is typically part of the expense of the trip I pay for. Never had any issues in the past, but this caused us to have to switch it over to his card and then have to come back when we checked out and wait to have them switch the card back to charge me instead. Also, extra driver is an additional $13/day here... another thing that has seemingly always been free at other places I've rented from before. They also try to really sell that full coverage insurance... we declined as we are covered through our credit cards, but they wouldn't stop pushing and used scare tactics to try to convince us that we weren't really covered through our credit cards like we think. I get it, but really wish they would not push after you willingly decline. They did not have the car we reserved available, so gave us a larger SUV without upcharging, so that was the only positive here. I feel bad for those in line after us... we were #3 in line but it quickly grew to span all the way outside and I can't imagine how long those folks waited...",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
148,"They tout a really good happy hour and margaritas with their signage, so we decided to stop in here before dinner and weren't really impressed. The margaritas were subpar and so were the chips and salsa.. which cost $5. I really don't like places that charge for chips and salsa unless you are a high end mexican restaurant that is serving it with some sort of salsa trio or gauc or something, but $5 is steep for a down home mexican restaurant. The worst part of the experience here was that the bar staff was not friendly. They seemed completely uninterested and that it was a burden when we wanted to order a drinks. We didn't have any food here so I can't speak for that part, but based on the service I would just opt to eat somewhere else altogether anyway.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
156,"Meh. We ate here mostly because we were tired of seafood and standard bar food, so thought we'd change it up by having pizza and it just so happened to be located in front of our condo, so it was convenient.We sat down right away, but it took the server a solid 10-15 minutes to do even stop by our table after the busser dropped off some waters. The beers were decently priced, but the pizza was over priced for what it was. We had the hawaiian and it is nothing to write home about.. maybe other menu items were good since this place has pretty high reviews but definitely would not recommend going out of your way to have pizza here.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
174,"We got into town late and we're staying in a hotel a block away. Saw this place out of our window and figured it was easy enough, but honestly there are so many great local restaurants in Portland that there is no reason to eat at a chain.I'll go ahead and cover the food and drinks first. Drinks were actually ok and they have some fun stuff on the menu - though not sure I would come to a bar for juice (like cold pressed juice). They brought a little skillet of biscuits and jam to the table to munch on... but the biscuits were barely warm and hard. I ordered a fried chicken sandwich and it probably ranks as one of the worst I've ever had. I didn't know crispy also meant dry as a bone. It was hard to get down and whatever ""White BBQ"" sauce it was supposed to have on it, it did not. Just bone dry chicken, a tiny pile of shredded lettuce with a little tomato and two tiny pickle slices on an over toasted sesame bun that fell apart as soon as I took a couple bites. I could not eat most of it and instead opted for the fries which were at least edible. As soon as they put our food down another lady rushed to our table and said ""here's the check"".. we both looked at each other a little perplexed and the waitress said ""sorry if you didn't want it yet but someone told me I needed to bring it over""Also, moving onto the ambiance/concept.. it's interesting.. there's a restaurant that's connected to a bowling alley.. and I'm not sure what was in the other entrance, but I'm guessing pool and karaoke. In theory, it's probably a fun place to meet up with a big group. Would not suggest a meal here though unless you're drinking and just want some bar food to nibble on.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
213,"I'll preface this by saying, maybe I'm biased because I live in Seattle where good seafood is rampant. After getting off our flight and checking into our hotel we headed out in search of a place to eat. Unfortunately a lot of places were slammed due to a conference at the convention center which just so happened to get out for the day, but this place looked cute so we ended up here. We ended up sitting up at the oyster bar and it took quite a while for someone to come give us menus and waters. It was busy, so we let it go. We were honestly not looking to have a fancy dinner, but cracked open the menu and was flabbergasted at the prices for even some of the more basic things like fish and chips. I'm usually not that much of a cheapskate, but I found myself in a situation where I was looking for the cheapest thing on the menu... so I went with the fish tacos and my boyfriend went with the fish and chips... yep, the $30 fish and chips. Maybe this is the upcharge for shipping fish in, but even the nicest seafood places in Seattle do not charge that much for the most basic fish and chips. This was cod we're talking about. Not halibut or a more expensive cut of fish. I also got 2 fish tacos that barely had any fish in them but were accompanied by a nice piece of black hair! I would've sent it back had I not bitten into the hair pretty much my second to last bite. Disgusting. The food also took forever, so there's that. Would not return here again. I suppose if you're actually looking to come and have oysters you can find some nice ones here, but it was a mistake as we were just looking to have some basic food - had much better fish tacos else where in SD for much cheaper too :)",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
216,"It's been 3 years since I did my last review of this place, so I figured it was time for an update. I finally ventured back here recently in hopes that it may've improved over the last 3 years but it's somehow gotten worse. I don't know how this place is still open, honestly. It was a nice day and it was steady - but not slammed.. quite a few open tables outside. We were seated and I knew we were going to be in for it the first thing we heard were the people right next to us getting served their food and the waitress asked ""is your drink better"" and the lady responded, ""yes, it's a little better and it taste like maybe they put some alcohol in it this time"" the waiter then put their food down and asked if they needed anything else in which the guy then responded, ""well.. yeah some silverware or maybe some napkins would be nice?"" At this point I'm looking at my BF and saying ""I told you think place hasn't changed"", but I try to stay positive. It takes a while for someone to come by, she eventually takes our drink orders, and that's when I hear the lady behind us again -- she's pissed now. She's flagged the waitress down and says, ""you know what, we waited a REALLY long time for our food and it's cold. Can you just give us our check and take the food back, we don't have time to do this"". GREAT. Another table gets seated next to us and is asking the waitress about happy hour drinks --- wait, it's happy hour? No one informed us or gave us that menu. Why is that not advertised? Once we find this out my BF orders a drink off the happy hour menu. He takes a sip and realizes it's def not what he ordered.. waitress apologizes, brings him the right drink and proceeds to serve the drink my BF just took a sip of to the guy a couple tables away. That sucks. We FINALLLLLLY get our fish and chips a mere half an hour later and surprise - not only does it look like something you'd get at a shitty food court on the ferry (honestly, I've seen frozen boxed battered fish that you can cook in your over at home that looks better) but shocker it's barely lukewarm. That lady behind us was right - what the literal F. How does food take that long and come out COLD? To top it off it took the waitress an extra 10+ mins to run our card cause she ""dropped all the cards she took"" and the next day after checking our bank account found that they charged us twice and we had to dispute it with the bank. To think this whole experience was close to $60 blows my mind. I never wish bad upon businesses, but I hope this place shuts it's doors and that someone who can run a restaurant opens something better in this prime real estate. This place has been riding the struggle bus for years and it's unacceptable at this point.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
217,"I really love both the el sombrero and the spicy kale Caesar, but the prices are like WTF. I ordered a regular sized el sombrero today and I swear this used to cost closer to 8$ but it cost me 13$ today. For. A. Salad. While it is good, it is also nothing that elaborate you couldn't recreate on your own - which is exactly what I'll be doing from now on. The only thing that might take some practice on recreating is the dressing.   Also the service was shitty and several of the people making the salads were coughing and hacking into their sleeves as they were handling the food. I was trying to catch a bus, and the guy scanned my card, handed it back to me and turned around and started talking, he turned back around to see I was still standing there and just stared at me and I said ""umm, I need to sign for it"" he looked dumbfounded ""ohhhhh I thought I like already had you do that"" proceeded to flip the iPad around to me upside down and went on to chatting with his coworkers again.

224,"I wanted to like this place, but this is the worst service I've ever had at a bar in a really, really long time. We were here on a Sunday night and there was only one bartender working - not sure if that's normal for them or not, I'm hoping not and that service might be better on another night and we just struck out. We chose to sit at the bar top because typically service is a little quicker when you're sitting at the bar. Not the case. We were ignored for a good 15 mins. I'm not over-exaggerating. We smiled and tried to make small talk with the bartender a couple times as he came over to rinse out his shaker at the sink that we were sitting in front of to sort of hint, ""hi, we're here and we'd love to order a drink"" and we got no where. At about the 15 min mark he finally asked us what we wanted to drink. Didn't get a ""sorry for the wait"" or ""thanks for your patience"", but hey whatever. Cue waiting 15 more minutes to receive our drinks. Oh, then he serves me a drink that is not what I ordered. Cue me waiting 10 more minutes to receive the correct drink. I didn't get a sorry once. No discount. No, go ahead and keep the wrong drink if you want to take that one too. Nothing. The drinks were ok (and expensive), but nothing to write home about. We're so glad our tiki bar expectations were exceeded the next night when we found Bootlegger Tiki at the other end of Palm Canyon Drive though. Much more quality drinks and the bartenders were some of our favorite during our entire trip!",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
226,"I really want to like the place. The design and the concept are right up the trendy alley, but I've been a couple times now for both HH and dinner and have felt let down everytime, especially for the prices. For HH I've had the fried chicken sliders - pretty mediocre and for a little bit more you can go down the street to El Gaucho and have some pretty good ones. Chickpea fries - flat out gross. I like hummus and don't have anything against chickpeas but this just did not hit the spot for me. They kind of look like those thick french toast sticks, except all chick pea. It was too mealy and soggy for me. I tried to stomach more than one and then when the server took the place and asked if we wanted to box and I said no, he replied ""what did you not like them?""... obvi not dude, no need to call it out. I would've rather had the side of mac'n'cheese, but when we got there at the beginning of HH on sunday they were ""out"". Must've sold them all at brunch? I guess they must make a set amount and can't boil anymore pasta and melt anymore cheese for the rest of the day?I came here with a big, corporate group for dinner as well during the week. We ordered a lot of drinks, and several appetizers to share with the table. Since it was a business dinner, we were there for a while, eating/drinking, and chatting. The main waitress was nice, but it didn't take long for the servers and runners helping her to look as if they were becoming annoyed with us. By dessert, there was flat out just running the desserts to the table and throwing them down, not saying what they were or leaving the correct dessert in front of the person who ordered it. I get it, serving large parties is probably not the most fun thing to do when there's multiple people shouting different appetizers and drinks at you but they guy who brought the dessert out could've saved the eye roll for when he go back to the kitchen or at least until he turned his back.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
244,"I reached out to their ""contact"" section on their website to give them a chance to offer up at least an apology after a terrible brunch experience and never heard back. I'll spare everyone the details, but long story short we arrived on Sunday morning to try brunch during a Seahawks game. We arrived 30 mins before the game started and put our order in promptly. We did not receive our meal until half time because their ""computer system was down"" and our waitress who walked by multiple times during this nearly 2 our time period (as we were seated right next to the server station) failed to notice we didn't have our food until nearly an hour in and finally went to check only to say ""oh it looks like the order didn't go through do you want to order again?"".... When our order was finally brought out only 1 meal was brought out the 2nd meal did not come out until almost 15 minutes later and part of that meal was missing.

250,"I've never seen an ihop express, but we needed a quick breakfast before heading to the airport. It's small inside, but basically you order at the counter, they give you a number to set on your table and they bring out your food. I got the stuffed french toast combo. Their commercials with oozing cream cheese stuffed french toast is not what came out. The middle of the french toast was still cold. Nothing like hard french toast and icy frosting in the middle. I chose not to say anything because this doesn't seem like the place you should say anything unless you want them to spit in your food. I'm just glad that it wasn't a meat or egg product that was cold. If you have the time, don't waste your money here.

254,"After a day of travel and eating during off hours, my boyfriend and I found ourselves hungry at about 10:30pm on a weeknight and staying next door at the Hyatt. We found that everything closes up shop in that area around 10p or 11p and we didn't want to pay for overpriced room service, so we booked it across the street because we knew this place closed at 11.We walked in at about 10:45 and I acknowledged we knew they were getting ready to close and asked if they were still accepting tables. The bar was already closed otherwise we would've grabbed a seat there because I realize it's super annoying to show up at a restaurant when all the workers want to do is wrap it up for the night. The 2 hostesses reluctantly and with an attitude told us they sat people until 11pm. They then whispered to themselves and when the girl started to walk us back to the table the other one replied, ""don't do it! you can't!"". The seated us in the very back corner of the restaurant away from all the rest of the tables of people still there eating. 10 minutes go by and no waters, no silverware, nothing. Finally a server that had walked by a couple times asked us if we had been helped and when we told her no she apologized, said that was horrible service and that it wasn't technically her table but that she would of course help us. She got us waters, took our order, and then came back and said even though their bread was supposed to be done for the night that she found a different type of loaf and heated that up for us if that was ok. About 10 minutes later the lady who was supposed to be our waitress showed up and apologized and advised she was on her smoke break and that no she had no idea that anyone had been seated in her section. That explains what the 2 hostesses were whispering about. We appreciated her apologizing as I'm sure it was not entirely her fault and it seemed as though the 2 hostesses threw her under the bus by putting us in her section when they knew she was on her break. She was fine the rest of the time and the other lady who had stepped in to wait on us also came by to check on us again. Really disappointed that I don't remember her name because that's an example of a great worker who takes on a table that isn't even her's at the end of a night.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
262,"This is a cute little place and was pretty busy late on a Friday night when we got into town. Due to the fact they were so busy, the service seemed to suffer. When we first arrived our server seemed to be attentive, but when he picked up the table next to us that seemed to really slow him down for some unknown reason. He walked by several times as he was helping the other table and we were already done with our food and had clearly put the napkins on the plates and shoved them to the edge of the table to signify we were done... but he just continued to go about his business. Same with the bill. When we finally got it, we stuck our card it in right away but it sat on the edge of the table for upwards of 15 minutes as he walked back and forth. This wasn't really the standard mexican restaurant we were expecting. There were chips and salsa, but those were extra. My boyfriend got enchiladas but that came with nothing else - no rice or any form of beans. Definitely not what we expected for the prices they are charging. I found the food to be totally underwhelming. I understand that it's a small tourist town and maybe I've just become spoiled living in Seattle where there's an array of great places to eat, but I am really surprised at all the comments that say they were blown away by the food here. If we're ever back in town I would stop in here for a drink, but wouldn't be my first choice to eat.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
263,"I decided to stray from the chain pizza joints and try this place one night. We ordered takeout. It was cute inside, the couple running the place seemed sweet, but I was unfortunately extremely underwhelmed by my pizza.I got a standard pepperoni pizza and we didn't finish more than 2 small slices because the cheese on it was so thick it was stomach ache worthy. It was literally at least a quarter of an inch thick.  We stuck it in the fridge and figured maybe we'd like it for left overs but just couldn't do it. We were snapping the slices of pizza in half because the cheese was hardened and thick. Don't get me wrong, I like cheese but the amount on here was almost outrageous.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
266,"I've worked in the area for a number of years now, so it's exciting to see new restaurants going in as the food variety in the area has been rather lackluster. I find myself at Pesos for lunch or happy hour quite a bit, so I thought this place would be a great alternative. I suppose my review below should be taken with a grain of margarita salt as this place has only been opened about a week or two and clearly has kinks to work out like any new restaurant.We arrived at about 5pm tonight (friday) in an attempt to grab HH. There was not an open seat or even any standing room in the bar, so we opted for a seat outside. The hostess was prompt and friendly and water and chips/salsa arrived right away, but that's where the good service ended. We both ordered margaritas which took nearly 10-15 mins to arrive and were brought out by someone other than our waitress... she showed back up about 5 minutes after to take our food order (so, 15/20ish mins after we sat down) and then awkwardly asked if we were going to want another drink soon. We had only taken a couple sips since they had nearly just arrived, but my boyfriend shrugged and said that he probably eventually would, and she replied, ""ok because I accidentally ordered an extra so it will probably be out in a minute"".... After that we didn't really see her and the couple times she did pass she did not offer to refill empty water or chips. When food finally arrived it was served by a man who looked like he could've been a supervisor or manager, but the orders were wrong. My boyfriend got his food (with the wrong sides) but they did not have mine. He came back about 5 mins later with my plate and my boyfriends correct meal. Literally every single table around us was getting incorrect orders. It eventually became a game of going table to table and saying, ""did someone out here order *insert name of dish here*"".... The ladies at the table behind us ordered drinks that never arrived so one finally went in and asked where they were, 10 minutes later still nothing so they mentioned it to the waitress as she walked by, but to no avail by the time we left these ladies were still drinkless. Oh, and the food was not good. They gave me about a 2 tablespoons full of rice and the chimichanga was soggy. My boyfriend said his sweet potato fries were cold upon arrival. We were a little shocked when we got the bill and it was nearly $60. That second round that the waitress ""accidentally"" ordered? Yep, we were charged for it. I did not voice my complaints or ask for a manager because the waitress was clearly struggling and seemed to be in a daze so I didn't want to make a scene or give her a harder time than she was already having.... but I am surprised that the meals seemed to be served by the manager helping out who should've taken note to the fact that things were clearly a hot mess and probably should've taken the initiative to comp or discount... or at least apologize! I'll let this place work it's problems out before I return because it certainly was not a $60 experience. The inside of the restaurant is beautifully designed though... for what that's worth.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
269,"I work in the area and since we always usually end up at one of the same 3 places for lunch, we decided to branch out and try this place even though it was a couple blocks further away from the office than we usually venture. I will start by saying that we had a large group... there were about 10 of us. None the less, service was slowwww. They were having issues with their soda machine that day so drinks were coming out strange. We had all ordered burgers or sandwiches and the majority of the group got their food at once, 1 of my coworkers got hers about 5ish minutes after, but still no sign of my food. The waitress noticed that she was short a meal (mine) and said that it was actually coming right now. Somewhat of a lie because we happened to be sitting right next to the kitchen where I heard her tell the cook that they needed to make another burger because they didn't make enough. My hungry coworkers picked at their food for another 15 minutes before mine arrived because they didn't want to be rude since I was the lone ranger without a meal. How awkward. Then when my food did arrive I was unimpressed. The burger was just ok and they gave me about 7 tater tots. I probably sound like a fatty for expecting more, but really?  I don't think our group or myself personally will be returning here anytime soon.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
278,"I came here for breakfast on a weekday morning before my flight out of town. Aimlessly wandering around, my boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place and decided we were tired of walking and didn't know where else to go. We were promptly seated but it took a good 10 minutes before anyone came by to take our order, let alone say hi and see if we wanted beverages. I ordered the waffle which came with some eggs. Just as our waiter finished taking our order the table next to us got their food. Two of the gals at the that table were in the restroom, but their other two friends were there so the waiter put everyone food on the table. Upon arriving back one of the girls sat down and said, ""what is this? I didn't order a waffle"". They flagged down the waiter, who took it back and gave her the pancakes she ordered instead. Well a good 15 minutes later, our order arrives and low and behold... guess they decided to give me the waffle that was rejected by the girl at the other table. One, that just sort of weirds me out even if the girl didn't touch it, but two - the waffle and syrup were completely cold as it had clearly been sitting for nearly 20 minutes. I didn't say anything because it was the kind of establishment where you're not sure if they'll spit in your food. Also, though the waffle was large - it looked and tasted like 4 eggo waffles that they pushed together. I know it's just a little sidewalk cafe as the name states... but for the price you pay, the food is not worth it. Great place to sit and watch a bum shoot up at 9am on a Tuesday though!",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
279,"This place was just ok for me. It's an ""upscale"" ish, commercialized mexican restaurant. Upon arrival, I did find their way of seating people to be absolutely bizzare. Instead of handing out a little beeper like most places in the mall or simply taking your name and number down on a clipboard.. they had these laminated cards that the hostess would use a dry-erase marker to put your name on and she had them all lined up on the hostess desk. Never seen it done like that before and I eat out quite a bit. Seems like a royal waste of time.Onto the actual food... we came here with the intentions of having happy hour, but the bar is a little sliver of a walkway in the restaurant and there were no more seats left, so we got stuck sitting down and having a full on dinner. The server was friendly and attentive. I did find the fresh tortillas interesting. Again, something I had never seen done before. I personally prefer chips and salsa, but it was a nice touch. The food was just ok. I wasn't blown away. I did like that it wasn't your standard rice and beans and I enjoyed the little corn cake. Other than that I honestly found the tacos I had to be a little blah. Not very flavorful. The watermelon margarita I had was a nice little refresher though.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
281,"Remlinger Ripoff is what this place should be called. It's fall... I live in Seattle and wanted to go to a pumpkin patch to simply walk around, gander through the corn maze and possibly sip on some hot cider. So my boyfriend makes the 1 hour trek out to Carnation to take me here. Also, I might mention that I have no children.We were directed to park in the area closest to all the buildings and away from the pumpkin patch and corn maze which is all we really had interest in. So we were kind of following the crowd from the parking lot into the main building not really knowing if we could just walk across to the corn maze or if we had to pay in the main building for admission. When we get up to the counter the lady rings us up - $34. Umm, what? I specifically told the lady all we'd like to pay for is the corn maze. ""No, sorry our prices are all inclusive, you can't pay for just one thing"". Whatever. We fork over nearly 40 bones... walked around the ""fall festival""... which don't get me wrong, if you have children it's probably well worth it, but if not, it's a highway robbery. We leave that side of the farm and walk to the side we really wanted to go to which is the U-Pick Patch and the Corn Maze. Upon arrival to the corn maze we notice there's no one manning it and checking to see if you paid or didn't pay. When we walked by the U-Pick pay trailer we noticed a little jar that said ""$5 donate recommended for the corn maze"". WHAT. So you're telling me I didn't even have to pay? I don't understand why 1. The lady at the counter flat out lied and 2. Why they are so misleading in general. Even if I had gotten online and done my homework I don't think it would've helped much as their website is even misleading by saying in bold text, ""back this year is the inclusion of our corn maze included in park admission!""... which to me signifies that the corn maze actually costs money. But clearly, it did not. This was literally like flushing $40 down the toilet. I won't even bother to go into the fact that this place is totally commercialized and I was actually quite shocked at how blown out this place was from the ""rides"" to the ""foodbooths"" I didn't know that I was taking a trip to a mini themepark.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
283,"I don't get the hype. I've heard a lot about this place via social media and was reading about how New Yorkers were going crazy recently when they opened a branch out there. Maybe I got the wrong burger... but I just don't get it. So I went with the truffle burger. Bun. Burger patty. Truffle Cheese. Very plain? The burger itself was juicy and flavorful and the bun was perfect, but as an overall burger I feel that I've had way better. Also, the burgers don't come with fries. I think a $12-14ish burger plus having to pay for fries is a little outrageous. You're looking at $20 a person for a simple burger and fries. The fries weren't all that special either. I didn't try to sweet potato fries, but had the shoestring fries that tasted like they were straight out of the Ore-Ida bag in the frozen aisle. You could at least maybe serve some real, handcut french fries if I'm paying so much.I do have to commend the staff though. Our waitress was great. We were visiting from Seattle and it seemed like most of our dining experiences on our trip had been lackluster and borderline horrible on a service front, but our waitress here was very attentive, quick, never let our drinks go empty, and noticed a mistake on one of our burgers as the food runner was setting our plates on our table. She promptly said, ""I can tell from here that your burger has something you didn't ask for it on it"", took it back to the kitchen and had them fix it right away. Good service, the food was just not as great as it was hyped up to be. Trendy at best.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
285,"So towards the end of the our meal I found out that this location just recently opened... which definitely explains why we had such a rocky experience here. It was a Sunday night, they were not busy and we were promptly seated on the patio. After our waitress took our drink order the drinks didn't show up for nearly 10 minute. Side note, don't bother to order any type of mixed beverage here or at any BWW. In my experience there is little to no alcohol in their mixed drinks whatsoever. Back to what I was saying - though the waitress walked back and forth at least 5 times, our order was not taken until we had already been sitting there for upwards of 20 minutes.. no joke. In this time we were waiting the party a couple tables down had called a manager over. This was my second indication that we were in for a long dinner. The table directly next to us, who had a different server was having problems as well. Apparently they had ordered an appetizer that just never showed up among other problems with their meals. Their server continued to apologize several times throughout the night, which eventually got annoying. Our food showed up with no issues, but overall dinner for 2 people took nearly 2 hours. A little ridiculous for a wing place on an off night. Hopefully this place will work their kinks out.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
299,"So this one time after I ate at Red Robin I got food poisoning. I should clarify, that it wasn't at this location, but none the less, it tainted the entire Red Robin chain for me. Ruined my appetite for ever going back and having bottomless steak fries. Five years later, I decided to give them a second chance and be a non-traditional city dweller and eat at a chain restaurant. The good news is that I didn't get food poisoning this time. The bad news is, I am just really unimpressed with their food. Their prices are fair, but I could not even finish half of my burger. My old staple was the crispy chicken sandwich, but I decided if I'm giving them a second chance maybe I should try what they are supposedly famous for... which is a burger. It was just, blah and filled with mounds of shredded lettuce. The steak fries? There were quite a few in my basket that were still cold in the middle. Nothing like biting into a half frozen french fry. Oh, and incase you're wondering... the reason their alcoholic beverages are reasonably prices is because there is literally ZERO liquor in them. My boyfriend ordered a top shelf margarita and there's no way the thing had more than a ""splash"" of liquor in it... if that.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
302,"I'm updating this based on my experience last night for ""national froyo"" day in which 6oz were supposed to be free - yet they decided to only accept printed coupons and each person had to have one. Cause that's not environmentally friendly or anything and we don't live in the 21st century, right? But that's besides the point because I know that comes down from corporate and it's not this stores fault. But it was yesterday that I realized this place is horribly designed if there are more than 10 people in the store. Be prepared for tons of unruly children and mom's who don't enforce any sort of manners on them because they're being equally in the way things and rude holding Magnolia Mom social hour in front of all the yogurt machines holding up the line of people just trying to get through and get some yogurt. Menchies has slowly been going down on my list.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
307,"I was disappointed in this place because it looks like a cool spot from the outside. It was a Sunday night - Labor Day weekend when we stopped in. Visiting from out of state, we had been up early and spent the entire day in Sedona, so when we got back in town we wanted a more low-key place to get drinks and some food. Searching online we saw that this place specifically boasted that it had ""50% off late night eats after 11pm"" on Sunday nights. Perfect. We arrive and it is dead. Ok, it is on the outskirts of the party scene going on further downtown, so maybe that should've been expected. The hostess awkwardly asks if we'll be drinking tonight. We sit outside, they have the music bumping pretty loud, and the couches and oversized chairs are actually pretty comfy... oh, and then there's that sloppy wasted girl sitting one lounge area away from you giving her boyfriend a lap dance and dancing around their table like a stripper. Really? Anyways, we order food (sliders and chicken ""lollipops"") and a couple drinks. The sloppy girl and her man eventually leave, and 45 minutes later our 2 small appetizers finally come out. It wasn't til about 30 minutes after we ordered that our waitress came up to apologize and say she was sorry the food was taking so long, but that right as we arrived they had actually closed down the kitchen, so when we and the table who arrived shortly after us ordered, they had to get everything in the kitchen back out. Seriously? I know it's not the waitresses fault, but why would you not mention that when we ordered. Also, why are you going to advertise your special on Sunday nights being ""late night eats starting at 11pm"" when apparently you decide to close your kitchen down at that same time? I understand when it's a slow night eventually someone has to make that call and say you're going to go ahead and close early... but if that's the case, mention it when we get there instead of making us feel awkward and like we're burdening you ask you clean up everything around us and basically shut the place down waiting for us to get finished eating. The food was ok, but the 45 minute wait spoiled it.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
309,"Very disappointed since the move. Don't get me wrong, the new space is a lot cleaner and not as sketch as where the old location was... but as someone else has mentioned there isn't nearly as much inventory as in the old store and it's always like a zoo in here. Areas of the space are awkwardly shaped and it makes it hard to get around with the masses of people that fill this place on pretty much any time, any day unless you come late during a weeknight. The only thing I have purchased here is a hair product and that's partly because I felt like I had to buy something because I'd just paid for parking. I have yet to purchase any clothes or shoes from here. I've noticed they have hardly anything from the BP and TBD depts. at this location, they don't have any active wear  section that I know of (ie: workout clothes like nike), and though the shoes are muchhhh more organized than any other location, since they are now out in boxes they take up a lot more room - which in turn means there's a lot less inventory out. I guess as a whole, there is just a lot less of everything here compared to their other locations. And their clearance section? tiny. maybe 3 racks? where as if you go to a location like Factoria, the entire back half of the store in front of the shoes is dedicated to clearance. I consistently leave this location disappointed and won't be frequenting it anymore unless I'm in the area for something else. I'd suggest the Factoria location as I've always been impressed with their selection... Also hoping that the new Northgate location will be good!",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
315,"There is only one time in my 20-something years so far that I've ever walked out of a restaurant -- and this time almost became the second time. There is no reason whatsoever that my breakfast should take one hour unless is it some culinary masterpiece. Breakfast is one of the quickest meals to make and neither my boyfriend or I ordered anything complicated. Ham, hashbrowns, eggs, and french toast. Not complicated.It was a Sunday morning and I understand Sunday's are typically the busiest breakfast day of the week. I mean I've been to Patty's Eggnest and waited 30 minutes before to be seated, but then have always gotten my meal served to me in less than 10 min after that, so it evens out. Here, we were seated right away, but it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to even come by and take our order and then about 30+ minutes after that our food finally came. 15 minutes in I saw the table right next to us that had literally ordered 2 minutes before us get their food so I thought... ""oh sweet, our food is probably coming out next!"" 10 minutes later... still nothing. 10 minutes later the table is done eating and getting their check. FINALLY 35 minutes of waiting later our food comes out. It is piping hot, which is great, but leads me to believe that they forgot to put our order in to begin with, seeing as the table seated on the other side of us, which got seated about 20 minutes into our waiting game got their food about 5 minutes after us. Hmm, doesn't make much sense? The food was ok. I got pineapple french toast and the size of the toast was good, it was thick and fluffy.. but there were only a handful of pineapple chunks on top and a dallop of whipped cream. The waitress never came by with any syrup and never asked it I wanted any. Like I mentioned, I came to the conclusion that our waitress must've forgotten to put our order in or the cooks skipped over it by mistake. If no one wanted to take the blame, I get that, it's kind of embarassing but not once the entire time we were there twiddling our thumbs that the waitress ever came over to say something like, ""i'll go check on your food"" or ""your food should be right out"" which to me is the unacceptable part. Guess she didn't realize we'd been sitting there for 30+ min with no food in front of us. It's too bad too because it's not like she was mean, she actually seemed really sweet but just never acknowledged the fact that it should've never taken that long to get french toast and eggs. Cool building, but bad service always turns me off so I doubt I will be back.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
318,"This place was ok, there are several other mexican restaurants in seattle I would rather go to though. Decided to try it out for late night happy hour because I knew Pesos would be packed and didn't want to go out to the Matador in Ballard and from reading the reviews I thought I may've discovered the a lower key tex-mex place that was just as good. It is lower key, but it wasn't as good to me.They may've before, but when I went they did not have any cocktails on happy hour - only wine and beer. The happy hour food was ok, nothing spectacular though. The nachos were soggy because there were not enough chips and too much beans, so we actually had to ask for an extra serving of chips. Also, not sure what kind of open grill they have in the kitchen, but I left this place leaving like a campfire - my clothes and hair reeked.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
322,"Let me start by saying this was my first buffalo wild wings experience and maybe i set my expectations too high. I was down in the area visiting and it happened to be NBA all-star weekend, so we stopped here to finally try this place out and watch the game. it's a great place to watch games, i'll give them that. The service though? sucked. maybe it was because it was busy, but to have me go my entire meal and not serve me any water or even ask is completely unacceptable to me. Hello, this is a wing place... for the most part, most wings a little on the spicy side... it seems like a no-brainer to me that water would most definitely be served almost immediately after you sit down (like it is at most eating establishments). It's not like we were sitting at a table tucked away in the corner, we were sitting at out outside table that the waitress had to walk by whenever she went to any of her other tables. Took quite a bit for her to even come over and order our drinks (which I assumed she would also bring back water). Someone else delivered our food and the only other time the waitress even returned to our table was at the end of our meal when I was so annoyed that I didn't have any water that we had to flag her down. Now I don't like waitresses that are at your table every 5 mins asking you if you're ok, but I don't appreciate the polar opposite either. Overall, ok food. ok drinks. middle of the road prices. bad/slow service.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
324,"I thought this place was kind of pricey for bar food..  I had the dock street burger, which I've read good things about online, but it was a pretty average burger. Nothing special. Their margaritas came in a small scotch glass, but was still full price from what I could tell. The staff was friendly and the service was ok, but probably not a place I would come again for a meal.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA

335,"mediocre food. even worse service.i was intrigued by this place, so I went to check it out on a friday night for a late dinner. after we got seated it took forever and a year for the server to arrive. i wasn't impressed with their drink menu - if you're into (expensive) gin drinks it might peak your interest. i ordered the mac n cheese and it was nothing special. my boyfriend had a burger and asked for ketchup... 10 minutes later, nothing. so we asked the busser/host after he got done seating the table behind us and walked by... he said he'd tell our waitress... 5 minutes later, nothing. the waitress finally shows back up to the table and says, ""oh i'm sorry i forgot your ketchup, i'll go grab it"".... 15 minutes later nothing. she must've completely forgot because she didn't apologize when she brought our check. they weren't rude, just absent minded and slow.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
339,"This atmosphere and ambiance at this place was really cute and I wanted to like it, but unfortunately just wasn't really impressed by the food selection. They had a couple salads, a couple burgers, and a couple more hearty entrees - but nothing that wowed me. I was on vacation and had been pretty burgered out already so I ended up with a the spinach salad. It was good, but they didn't crumble the blue cheese well enough so I ended up with huge balls of blue cheese that I had to break up because a mouth full of blue cheese is a little much for me personally. My boyfriend had the fish and chips and he said they were ok, but not great. I tasted his fries and they tasted like any other place. The waitress was really bubbly and nice too so it was a bummer that the food was just ok and that the prices were a little much for what it was.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
341,"The service here is some of the worst I've experienced in a while. I partially understand because it's a bar, but to wait nearly 10 minutes while at least 3 different waitresses have walked past you and even made eye contact with someone who is twidling their thumbs - no drink, no food, no water in front of them - is a little unacceptable to me. The table was dirty, but we had to snag it right away because there wasn't an empty seat in the place, but the waitress didn't even offer to wipe it down when she finally did get to us. I had two fish tacos and I'm glad I only ordered two because they were huge. They were really good and the white sauce they put on them is delicious. Overall, the food was good, the drinks were ok, but the service was enough to probably not make it a place on my list to go next time I'm in town. Another strange thing - cash only!! I know a couple small burger joints that are run that way, but it's a first time I've seen a full service restaurant and bar pull out that rule.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
344,"lots of little burger places seem to be popping up around seattle, so thought i'd go check this one out. it's located in what seems to be a transformed garage and they have a cute little outdoor eating area and also a parking lot right on the side of the building.for my burger, i went with the classic and added some bacon and cheddar. it was just ok, whatever sauce they put on it was a little different, i dont know if it had onion in in or what (i don't like onion on my burgers), but it had an onion-y aftertaste. also, i think there was mention on the menu board about how they cook their burgers pretty rare and i believe it, as my burger was pretty pink in the middle. the fries come seperate and unlike their menu on their website which says they have waffle and thin cut fries, it seems they only have regular handcut fries there now. the fries were pretty good. also decided to get a milkshake and went with the oreo. there was not a lot of shake, but a lotttt of oreo. my cup was half full of oreos and as i was trying to wash down my burger i was desperately seeking more vanilla shake. made me wish i would've gone for the salted caramel shake.overall, it was ok. if i had to choose, hands down i would pick red mill or even dick's as a better burger. but the place was cute and the staff was really friendly.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
348,"I don't think I've ever been so aggrivated at a place that the first thing I do when I get home is get on here to tell people about how much this place sucks. I have no hesitantion in giving this place a 1 star after what I encountered there today.My boyfriend signed up for a membership a couple months and had put me down as someone they might bring in as a guest or whatnot. The sales people here had noooo hesitation in calling my cell phone multiple times and leaving me voicemails about how they wanted me to come in and check out the gym and that I could come in and try it for free. Great sales pitch, right.Oh, but when I arrive today with my boyfriend and he tells the brat of a front desk lady she says, ""it's going to be $15""... excuse me? my boyfriend then told her about the guest pass, she looks at us like we're crazy and she's like, ""sorry nothing is coming up, can you umm, like move to the side or something"". I was appalled. We had been standing there for less than 1 minute tops. Not like we were just hanging out at the front desk getting in everyones way. Granted, there was someone that walked in behind us to swipe his key, but a simple 'ok, let me look into that but would you mind stepping to the side for a minute so i can swipe this other key really quickly' would've been much more appropriate. Not your smirk little attitude. She went on to explain that she would just ""let me in"" (oh, wow, how generous of you front desk lady) but she simply couldnt because i had to sign a waiver and she'd have to take $15. You can pack sand LA Fitness. If you think that telling me I have to pay $15 to get in to use your equipment for 45 minutes for one day would talk me into just getting a monthly membership seeing as that $15 is probably a 1/3 of a monthly membership you are sadly mistaken.not only am I not going to pay $15 to use your damn elliptical for less than an hour, but now there's no way in hell i'd ever consider getting a membership at your place with the attitude that your employees have with me being in their way for less than 1 minute.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
349,"best fish and chips? really? i am so shocked to see all the great reviews for the fish and chips here. i've lived in washington practially my whole life and have eaten at several different fish and chip eateries and this one would rank probably my lowest... i've had better at chain restaurants that don't even specialize in seafood... i feel bad that i dragged my boyfriend here and touted to him that this place was going to have the best fish and chips based on what i'd been reading on here.first off, the service was terrible. you seat yourself, so we walked in sat down, the waiter definately made eye contact with us sevearl times, but yet it still took him nearly 5 minutes to even come by and set menus on the table for us. there were only 4 other tables that were occupied at the time and there was another waitress as well. another nearly 10 mins to get waters and then the food took quite a while. the table right next to us ordered literally right before us and they were finishing up their meal just as we were getting ours.the servings are big - i will give them that for sure. they give you enough french fries to serve to the whole restaurant. the problem is they aren't anything special that makes me want to eat the whole damn basket. they are your basic cafeteria fries that they probably gets delivered by the america food service truck. the pieces of fish were very large as well, but i was not a fan of the breading. i ate one piece and i was done. if you want decent fish and chips i would suggest Spud's or Ballard Bros",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
350,"i'm crossing my fingers that not all the romio's in town are like this one because i really wanted to like this place since it's right down the street from my house. first off, i call to place my order and the guy just answers, ""hello""... wait, did I call the right phone #? did i get some random guys cell phone instead? i hesitantly continue telling him I wanted to place an order and he just says, ""uhh ok""... didn't ask me what i'd like or say ""sure what would you like""... but whatever. so i tell him what I want and he tells me when it'll be ready and is so quick to hang up that i can barely squeeze in the, ""oh by the way my name is jessica""i show up, the place is pretty dark and dingy inside... pay for my food, get home and it all actually looks really great. i got some italian meat pizza and the pieces of meat were really big and hearty.... only problem is - the damn crust wasn't cooked! WTF. i was so grossed out. under all the toppings the dough was still gooey... ugh. i basically ate the toppings. i considered calling them back and telling them, but with the i-dont-give-a-crap attitude i got when i called to place an order, i figured they really wouldn't give a crap if i called back to complain.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
351,"the waiter we had was very helpful and attentive, but i've had better food. i was not really impressed with any of the appetizers - they have a cheese plate and a meat plate, both were very small servings. i had the halibut for dinner, which was ok except the fish lacked any kind of flavor or seasoning. i don't know if thats what the intention is, but i'm more of a flavor kind of person. deserts were just ok, nothing spectacular to write home about. one thing i will say is, they have amazing croutons. i did have the romaine salad and those croutons were delish.... not sure if they bake them in house, but that was certainly the best part of the meal for me!",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
357,"new to the area and was wanting to get some chinese takeout... this place is right down the street from my house so i decided to give it a shot. The pricing is fair and cheaper than other places for what you get, but i was not impressed with the food. I got fried shrimp and those were the only things that i would say were fairly decent. The fried rice was bland and lacked any sort of flavor what-so-ever. The sweet and sour pork was more like all tempura batter and tiny tidbits of pork... and the tidbits of pork that were in there were hard as a rock and over fried. i think i'll continue my search for chinese-american takeout elsewhere.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
363,"I've been on a quest to find a family owned/homestyle family type restaurant that lives up to the one i used to go to in my hometown which is a couple hours north of seattle... but i'm sad to say la palma is not it for me. I arrived and tried to order a margarita and the waiter informed me they are not allowed to take the vertical drivers licenses (i'm a few years over 21, btw) that was strike one for me. Their chips and salsa were not that great... salsa was extremely watery. I always order a chimichanga. It never fails me... but this one I could barely get down. The chicken was not shredded very well at all and they used dark meat and it was rubbery and watery yuckkkk. i prefer white meat chicken. and there were no beans inside! wtf, a chimichanga is supposed to be a deep fried burrito. don't burrito's generally have refried beans in them?! it was deep fried, plain, watery, rubbery, dark meat chicken. the spanish rice was good, i will give them that, but i was disgusted by the chimichanga... definately don't think i'll be returning.also, the place was dark, dingy and really sketch feeling inside.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
368,"Let me start off by saying I waited 30 mins before i had to get up and say something to the front desk ladies about how I'd been waiting for a half an hour and was just curious how much longer it would take. I was a bit irritated that I had been sitting right in front of the desk for 30 min and no one even noticed. Good thing I said something or who knows how long I would've been waiting there patiently. What happend was there was a mix up and I had that inkling from the beginning. I have a common name so when my name got called I stood up, but a girl that just happend to have the same name as me and an appt around the same time waltzed through the front door without even checking in and took my appt. It all worked out and I ended up getting the stylist that was supposed to do her hair, but I was just disappointed that it took initialive by me, the client, to point out that i'd been sitting in their waiting room for nearly 45 mins. I got 30% off for waiting, so I was glad to see that they took initiative to offer that up, no questions asked. Also, in their defense, the front desk is a little nuts. You have people paying, checking in, and it's like a zoo. I personally think they are overbooking their students there. There were several students that came up while I was waiting that either had to come out and tell their client they were running way over on their other client or telling the receptionist to make calls for them telling their client they didn't have time to do their hair.I came in for just a trim and was satisfied with the job that was done. I'm not sure if I would ever come here for much more than that. There are people running around everywhere. My chair was basically in the walk way. I had to stand for half my trim. The week before, I had gotten my foils done at the Advanced Training Academy downtown and they seem much more organized there. Still a little crazy, but much more tame than this place. My haircut cost $9, it's normally $14... but it got balanced out because I got talked into buying one of thier products, which seemed rediculously overpriced for me, so we'll hope that it actually works.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
373,"Came here about mid-day for lunch and were served promptly. The waitstaff seemed to be pretty attentive and helpful. Just wasn't very impressed with the menu. Not much selection only a handful of burgers choices, a couple salads, and a few main dish type meals like pasta and steak. The appetizers were more appealing to me than the meals (like the fried mac n cheese or mini grilled cheeses), but an app was the same price as a full meal, so I opted for a meal. I got the munchburger and it was good. It was a big, juicy burger, but the sauce made it pretty messy. The boyfriend got it without the sauce and it looked much more manageable to eat. The presentation is nice - the fries come in a little bucket and they give you a personal mini squeeze bottle of ketchup. I thought the fries were overcooked though - they were really dry.Overall, next time I would probably only go for appetizers and drinks. I think there are plenty of better places in lincoln and bellevue square that have more selection as far as meal choices. Oh, and like everyone else has mentioned the bathroom sink is something hip that turned out confusing. I had to lean down and look around for where the hell the soap dispenser was hidden and where the water flow actually was.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
378,"I was disappointed in this place. One thing I will say is that it is very organized and clean - not like a typical thrift store. Other than that, for being in a building that used to be a grocery store, I expected a bigger parking lot. I had to circle around a couple times and wait for someone to leave before snagging a spot. I found the selection to be mediocre. I just moved here so I was in search for some odds and ends housewares, decor, and furniture that I might be able to revamp. I was shocked to find that they had only a couple pieces of furniture. I also casually browsed the clothing aisles and was a little taken back by the prices. This was my first time at a value village, so I'm not sure if it's normal, but for the younger juniors clothes, most prices were $14.99 and up... seems like a little much for used clothing, but maybe that's just me...I actually prefer the Goodwill in Ballard over this store. I found a lot more selection down there and I found their prices to be more reasonable.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
386,"a lot of places on maui close up early, so we went to the bar here one night when we were hungry but almost everything was closed. we didn't have drinks, but ordered food instead. the chicken quesadilla was good - it was a big portion. my boyfriend had a burger and fries which was also a large portion and they actually stuff the cheese inside the burger patty, so that looked yummy. the chips and salsa weren't that great though for a 'mexican' restaurant. the chips tasted stale, but i'm not sure if they were or that was just the style of chip..we were surprised at how packed it got, then again, it was a friday night i suppose. it's a really small bar and it looked like most of the people in there and hanging out outside were locals, so we felt a bit out of place.  unfortunately, didn't get to try out the actual restaurant upstairs because the kitchen closed at like 9 and i didn't get to check out their happy hour menu because that didn't start til 10.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
390,"I figured the place looks fun and I passed it up the last time I was in town, so why not. Sadly, I was disappointed.First off, the hostess was awkward. She seemed to be in a daze when asking my boyfriend and I questions... ""sooo.. what are you guys up to?"" .. ""oh. really"" .. ""so uh what are you doing in maui?"" .. ""oh.. really. you're visiting? that's cool."" and she would look at us so intensely like she was very interested in our answer, yet she talked back in such a daze... it was just very awkward and uncomfortable.The waiter we had talked us into, ""the best blue hawaiians you will ever taste on this island. strongest drink we have on the menu"" and for $9 which is the typical price for a drink now adays anyways, it came with a free glass, so why not. Wow, what a rip. Honestly, tasted like water. I would be embarassed to have told someone that is the best and strongest drink in the house and then serve some watered down fruit punch up to someone. The service was very quick, I'll give them that. But for what we got, it was pricey. Dinner with the drinks for 2 of us was over $50... and I think $50 would've gotten us a nicer dinner somewhere else. Reminded me to steer clear of the chain type restaurents in touristy places. You're far better off going to somewhere more unique.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
393,"crap-ple bee's is what this place should be called. only reason this restaurant is still here is because in this town people really don't have very many other options and this is the only sit down chain restaurant.the food is never great, it's always mediocre. the prices are decent and i guess the happy hour is ok.worst thing about this place is the service. i don't understand why it takes 15 minutes for drinks to be served? and i don't understand why on multiple occassions my appetizer comes at the same time, if not after the meal arrives. what is the point of ordering an appetizer to hold you over before your meal if it doesn't ever come before your meal? after complaining once, the manager came by to tell us she wouldn't charge us for it since it came 10 minutes after we were into our meals. service wise, this place just can't seem to get it right. even on nights that it is not crowded the service still takes forever and in my opinion, the quality of their food has gone from being ok to bad.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
394,"maui airport is small, so this was the only restaurant there besides the 'food court' type area that was connected to sammy's.the menu is small and it's pretty pricy for what it is, but since it's in the airport, i guess they can get away with that. mixed drinks seemed rediculously expensive. the drink 'special' they had going on the day we ate there was a regular old captain morgan mojito... for $11.50. not a very special price if you ask me.service was very fast though. boyfriend ordered a decent sized burger and it was out in like 7 minutes maybe.",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA
395,"boyfriend and i stayed here last year last minute. we were staying with a friend while visiting oahu, but decided that on our last night we'd get a hotel downtown because it was much closer to the airport than our friends house. this was the cheapest hotel that had a good proximity to the beach.that's about the only thing it has going for it - the fact that it's right across the street from waikiki beach. other than that, i found it to be quite ghetto (for the lack of a better word). first off, not much of a lobby at all... second off, the elevator is tiny and it was a sketchy ride up to the top floor. though our room was at the top, it was located on the backside which looks right down into a scary alley and your view is of a concrete wall of the building next to the hotel.the room was very outdated... the decor was bleh. lets just say the whole room is a nasty, mildewy pink color. it has sort of an asian theme... the beds were the most uncomfortable hotel beds i've ever slept in. motel 6 beds were wayyyyy better than this. they didn't have any rooms with king or queen beds, so we got stuck with 2 twin beds. they may call them double beds, but they were some small doubles. these beds were the size of my dorm bed when i was in college. the matress felt like a board. the only semi updated thing this room had was maybe the bathroom. the fixtures and shower looked new. i suppose if you're just looking for a cheap place near the beach to crash at night this would do... but if you're looking to spend any time in the hotel or get a good nights sleep or at least feel like your on a pleasant hawaiian vacation, i would suggest looking elsewhere...",oxo1EWFAR8nQJoSFvZG6xA

423,"This place gave me a terrible first impression. I don't know if it was because it was a Monday morning, but the service was terrible. It started in with me walking in, confused. I wasn't greeted by anyone, so instead I wandered over to the bar very confused and asked, ""Do I just sit anywhere?"" and then the response was yes, so I took a seat at one of the booths. Next, I sit and look at the menu, within five minutes, I knew what I wanted, but the server didn't even come to check on me once, or ask what I wanted to drink. I sat for at least 30 minutes before she came and took my order (I calculated it from the time I posted on my snap to the time she finally came). There were so many opportunities for the server to take my order, but she didn't! She bussed a table before she took my order. I was honestly getting ready to leave. But, she took my order.Next, since the server took so long to get my order, I decided to time how long it would take for the food to come out, 17 minutes. May I mention that there were only 6 people dining at the restaurant (one lady had her nice big Rottweiler too yay). The food wasn't worth the wait, it was okay, but not worth 47 minutes of waiting or $13. They only gave me one piece of toast WHATTATATAT. I'd maybe give this place a second chance if their service was faster. But again, the food wasn't up to the hype. I ordered country-fried steak, the coating on the steak was minimal and kept coming off every time I cut a piece. As for taste, everything tasted average. The water also tastes like there is something in it, so I would have the restaurant check that out. One last note, the server never came to check on me after I got my food. After I finished my whole plate, some lady from the back came and took my plate for me. I waited 12 minutes for someone to come with my bill, I was dining alone, so I thought it would be obvious that I was ready for the bill, but nobody asked if I was. After 12 minutes, I was sick of waiting, so I went to the front where my server was (She was behind the bar) and told her I was ready to pay. If this is the method of checking out of the restaurant, the server should make it clear to the customers upon arrival so that the business doesn't have irritated customers sitting at their tables waiting for someone to come with the tab. The server had a friendly personality, but she was not considerate of me, the customer. The thing that brought this review down the most was definitely the customer service. It's a shame. Young's Restaurant is so much better. Taradise Cafe has potential, but it seems that the restaurant staff are a bit lazy, take the critical feedback and improve your establishment. Again, maybe y'all aren't that bad (it was a Monday), but my experience here was terrible.",DP4BchE8S9BMxsh3lcBTrQ

Uh. 7/10. Basically just watery marinera sauce with fettuccine and a poultry amount of assorted seafood. It's good... but not great.

The basic tuna roll was below average... the yellow tail with avocado was basically gas station sushi. Avocado was browning and fish wasn't fresh... my guess is that they cut the fish, made the roll, and stored it in a fridge until it got ordered.

Dude is walking back and forth picking up random things and talking to other coworkers. Haaaa.... Another group just sat down close to us. If they get service first, we walk out.We just walked out. There goes 40 minutes of my life.Y'all blind? Bored of life? Busy? Scratch that, there were FOUR EMPTY TABLES before we sat down. THE THREE THAT GOT HELPED SAT AFTER US.So I conclude blind.

There is a special place in hell for you. But hey, wait a minute! Technically, I got a pike place brew!!! BUT, I'm never coming back to this Starbucks location. Will it make a difference?

646,"My dog comes home tired and worn out, but that's probably the best thing about this place. We thought this would be a good dog day care because of their cleanliness, hours of operation (M-F 6:30AM-7PM) and location.They didn't open until 7AM this morning. The employee did not seem to care that their delay caused me to be late for work. I voiced my issue with the associate at the time of drop off but clearly, she didn't care enough...I was able to pickup my dog by 12, again, I tried to explain the situation to a different associate hoping she would take care of it professionally. Nope. I was handed a card and had to email the manager. Apparently, this is a ""small family owned shop"" - it is acceptable because ""mistakes happen"" but to not apologize or to make it up to the customer is piss poor service. Honestly, I had high hopes for this place. They've been late twice before but by 5-10 minutes prior to this morning. I gave them the benefit of the doubt, maybe there was traffic? This morning was totally unacceptable, though. No excuses for opening a shop 30 minutes late, causing conflict on my personal schedule/time. How am I expected to trust this place if this is how their employees conduct a business? I've already paid the cost for 10 full days, and feel like I should get a refund for the rest of the visits we haven't used.

I came in at 7pm requesting 160 double sided colored copies and the worker with the snooty attitude gave off an EXTREMELY off putting vibe. Came in the following morning and the worker who was ringing me up, rang me up for the incorrect amount. So I'm currently having to wait for their system to ""audit"" my refund then I can get my money back...After about 10 minutes, I told him I was running late and he said, ""I know.""

We saw people sit down with fat pieces of fish and a few fish sandwiches. I was totally sold. We ordered a one piece halibut + chips, and waited a few minutes for our food. The fish lacked seasoning, it was like there was none, not to mention it was over cooked... The batter was greasy and had no flavor, even lemon juice couldn't help it. Chips were soggy, looked like they were mass fried and sat under a warmer until an order was placed. I honestly don't think house-made tartar sauce could've saved them at this point, in my opinion.

657,"This was probably one of the worst dining/service experiences I have ever had. I came along with 6 others for a brunch yesterday based off the raving reviews. But just wait for it...The wait was about 45 mins, five mins over what they estimated but it was no issue at all. 12:45-1:00 pm: We finally get seated after being shoo-ed out of the restaurant while waiting for our table to be put together. The table ware is cute, we love the feel of the place so far. Music is softly playing in the background. Our waiter finally comes by to take drink + appetizer order (four mimosas and one beer) after twenty minutes of us patiently waiting. The drinks finally come and we're missing one mimosa - no big deal, just make us another one and bring it over, right? Instead, two waiters come by confused as hell wondering what's going on. I wish they would've just looked at our ticket and compared it to what we have on the table instead of making it a huge deal. After flagging down who seemed to be the manager, we placed our order. She made great suggestions then warned us that our appetizer was going to take 20 mins! No big deal though, it came by a few minutes after she placed the order with the kitchen. Baked Brie is kind of hard to mess up, in my opinion but it was good. Our food came out about 25-30 mins after receiving the app, which isn't too bad of a wait. We get our food and realize that the kitchen messed up on one order and duplicated another dish but gave it to us so we could have something to eat while waiting for the replacement. The food itself is alright, I've had much better brunch in Seattle and different restaurants in Tacoma. 15 mins later, the replacement comes but wait staff is no longer to be found after they drop off our final dish. Do y'all have your seat belts on?? Because this is where it goes down hill. No one checked in on us once they dropped off the final correct dish. They seated us in our own section up in the front and BLASTED the music. I kid you not, my aunt had to step outside because her head started to hurt. When my other aunts walked through the back to the rest room, patrons were being waited by waitstaff and the music was the same soft music we all heard as we were being seated. Was this their way of telling us that we need to eat and get out? I'm sorry but I haven't seen my aunts in a year and they traveled from all over, California, Renton and Raymond, WA. We came to have brunch and we came to enjoy each other's company and catch up on a nice cold 38 degree fall day. Oh, did I mention that they opened up the door and no one else was affected but the front of the restaurant aka our table of 7. On a nice COLD THIRTY EIGHT DEGREE FALL DAY? fuck. Can it get any worst?? Why yes, it can...I literally had to go up to the counter and wait for someone to swing by to get their attention, for a check, a box and even to drop off the card because I knew that we would've waited for another 20 mins for someone to even drop by. And of course, I went up to the counter to pick up the card as well. I'm not sure if this was some form of discrimination but HOLY SHIT? I will never go back due to lack of service. No patron should ever have to ask for service when the rest of the restaurant is being waited on, like a normal restaurant should. We all agreed that we won't be back and won't recommend this place to our friends or family. How do you spell BOUJIE? S-E-L.I forgot to mention, there were chunks in my boyfriends beer... too bad we couldn't tell a server because NO ONE CAME BY",RNbgsPuTi6UKh2D-W9xIig

The rep I spoke to on the phone was nice but seriously, an hour wait for a replacement? Zeeks goofed on our order and expected us to wait a whole hour for a new pizza to be made?

680,"I walked in and was greeted by the kitchen staff and a nice lady who worked the cash machine. I ordered the Chicago style gyro combo and paid $10:35 after tax. I waited 3 minutes for my food like whaaaaaat! The lady was really kind and even called my little sister, who she thought was my daughter, beautiful :) I love how the fries are real potatoes and not frozen like the ones from Aladdins or Mawadda. So, I got home, opened up my bag and I took everything out. A gyro wrapped in foil and a box of fries with an extra side of sauce. When I unraveled my gyro, it looked weird and wonky. tomatoes and onion on the bottom, really THICK slices of gyro meat with no crisp edges, the pita was warm and soft but a little too soft... I took a bite and I was not surprised or wowed. Not even blown away, especially with the crazy weather outside.The meat looked weird, barely had any flavor. I couldn't taste any spices. There was no lettuce... I really don't know what else to say about this place. I can't stand mawaddas wait and alladins is so far from the south end, so I came here hoping to find a gyro place that I would fall in love with. If this is what they call Chi-Town style then I don't like it. From now on, I will travel from 98118 to 98105 to get my gyro combo from Aladdins for $7.15 for a gyro, fries and a pop.

702,"I brought my family here for Labor Day weekend and I was expecting it to be a good time since my husband and I stayed here once before but a couple of years ago but staying at the resort was the worst idea we could've ever made. If you want to experience the worst customer service and expensive casino food then this is the place. I rented two suites and spent a good amount of money because I was hoping that my family would be able to get the full on Richmond experience. Checking in was easy, I signed the usually papers, got charged my huge bill and then was told our rooms weren't ready which was fine because we were about 15 mins early. No big deal. I was told that since I did all the paperwork all's I had to do was show my drivers license to pick up my keys. We parked the car walked back in about 30 mins later to get our keys and was told only one of our rooms were ready. Ticked off because I had a new baby and my parents who are 70 + didn't need to be walking around waiting. I take my family up to one of the rooms after the front desk lady, a total bitch, made me basically go through the check in process again because she didn't know how to find me in the system. Didn't apologize, was just a bitch. I asked her when my second room would be ready since it was well after 4 at this point and she said soon but I should call down before trying to get my keys. I called about 15 mins later and was told it was ready. When I came down, I happened to get the same bitch who told me it still wasn't ready and then she said I told you to call down, I said I did and she acted like I was lying. I asked to complain and speak to a manager and she told me I could write a note and she would hand it to them, I highly doubt she was an honest person and I am sure she would have just thrown it away. I told her the customer service was horrible and that they didn't do a good job at explaining where the parking was, the elevators were... you know, the basics... their JOB. After 5pm so we'll over an hour we finally get our rooms, after going up and down the damn building multiple times. After my blood was boiling I thought you know tomorrow let's try to make it a better one. I take my family down to redeem my ""free"" breakfast that I practically paid for with the expensive rates I was charged and then the lady told me we needed tickets!!! Are you kidding me?!?! We WEREN'T given OUR tickets.  So I walk downstairs hoping I would get the same witch gal I had to deal with the day before. I informed the guy that the horrible lady who checked me in didn't give me my breakfast tickets and once again I had to go all the way down to ask for them. He made it seem like he didn't understand wtf I was saying and I told him to give me my free breakfast tickets. After typing non sense he handed them over. My one suggestion for this dumb place is to learn what decent customer service is. How about you don't treat your guests like they're shit and do your fucking job. Needless to say, I will never come to this place ever again and I wouldn't suggest others, who are coming with families especially waste their money or time here. Wayyyy better places to stay at.

I've never been one to review but because I base a lot of my visits on how well places do on Yelp, I figure I could save people some time and money by letting you know how horrible the quality of service is here. My fiancé and I purchased a sectional here September of 2015, we bought a house up the hill from there so figured that it was convenient enough to stop our search (worst idea ever) here and go ahead with the purchase. On the day of pick-up which was about 3 weeks after, my aunt and I waited 45 mins to load up what they said would be ready! Not only that, we had to assist the guys who were loading.... Are you kidding me?! Upon loading up the couch we were told the ottoman (that came with the set mind you), wouldn't arrive for another 3 weeks.... We had a house warming coming up and needed it ASAP. If we would have known this was the case from the beginning we probably would've not gone through with the purchase. They weren't at all apologetic, didn't want to explain why this was happening and quite frankly didn't care... Why should they right? They got all their money. After 4 months... With endless amount of emails and back and forth the stupid ottoman arrived. They gave us $100 store credit which I used to get 2 pillows worth $20. I will never return and I don't suggest you settle with them either. Lesson learned!",q2KEuDWUM8_ErdhZakos8A

732,"First things first - the food was okay (went here for breakfast), just about average but nothing to complaint about. The 1 rating is not for the food but our experience overall because of the attitude of our server Monika. She was extremely irritated while taking our order and made it obvious. We asked for sugar because there was none at our table and she didn't care until we reminded her again. Our order took forever to come (30+ mins) which is also understandable at times but you'd expect the staff to acknowledge the fact. When we mentioned the delay, she again passed some remark with an ""I don't care"" kind of attitude. What was concerning was the difference in her attitude at our table vs. the ones next to us - we could see her asking others if they wanted anything else or just following up in general but surprise - nothing at our table! I just read through the other reviews of this place and this review isn't the first mention of this particular sever's attitude.

I walk in and notice a lady is speaking very loudly on her cellphone. I'm thinking okay, maybe it'll be a quick conversation and I can start relaxing when she's done.

While waiting for our food, I noticed a male customer who came in after us get his food... hmmm maybe he called it in. Then a couple of young ladies get their appetizer, then entrees. Then a to go order and then another. Hmmmm it's been at least 30 minutes. Does it take this long to made okra gumbo? Because I know it doesn't take this long to fry tofu or okra.We ask the host how much longer it will be? He says let me check. He goes to the register to print the receipt and then takes it to the back. Miraculously, our entrees appear in five minutes. Okra still is no where to be seen. Was there an apology? ""Oh I forgot to submit your order, I'm sorry."" or ""I'm sorry for the wait."" No just him going back to what ever was going on on his cellphone. Really?!Delicious food? Yes. Good service? No. Clean? No. Will I be back to spend my hard earned money? No.",uHtu4wW3WdygQtNMOmlILQ
1061,"Like everyone else says, if I could give this place negative stars I would. Majority of the time when I'm coming here to send something out after waiting an eternity in line, the employees are nice.Unfortunately for me, majority of the time I come here, it's to find a package the non permanent delivery person has not delivered. Every time I end up speaking to a manager, who says they are going to follow up, but NEVER do. In the last two years, this post office has successfully lost 3 packages. The first, a Warriors 73 wins tee I ordered for my SO. Mine arrived, the delivery person scanned the other and said it was delivered but yet it had to call Kohl's to get a refund. The second, a $90 dress I ordered as a Bridal Shower gift from me and two other girls. Again scanned and ""dropped off."" Yet here I am on the phone calling Lulu's to reorder it and waiting to file a claim to get a refund. And now, a Warriors cupcake tee that proceeds went to charity. Guess what? Yep, scanned and ""dropped off."" How do you ask they guy printing these shirts for a refund or replacement when proceeds went to charity?!?! Get your sh*t together USPS!!!! I and I'm sure many other SL residents are sick and tired of your lack in efficency in doing ONE job!! Delivering the mail!!

1085,"Date: 7/29/15Time: Around 10:45amWeather: Sunny and WarmI went to this 24 Hour Fitness because I didn't see the Super Sport down the street. The gym is upstairs from a vocational school. You can use the elevator or the stairs to get up there. Took the stairs since I figured it would look bad to enter the gym on an elevator. Although, I was staying at a hotel with no elevator. I had a delicious chili cheese Pink's Hot Dog around midnight and figured I'd better do some work so it did not immediately attach itself to my hips.The person at the desk was very nice and even helped me open headphones I had to purchase because I forgot mine. Mike (who teaches classes there) made me feel very welcome as I was there to see the A's take on the Dodgers. (He was from the Bay as well!) So I'm walking in, feeling great.That was until I got to a treadmill in the back of the room that was denied any and all ventilation the building MAY have had to offer. 10 minutes in, I was sweating like a hog. Or maybe the hot dog had something to do with it. Either way, it was HOT! I did a mile and a half before deciding I just couldn't take it anymore. I moved on to weights. There was no wait for machines! Awesome! But when I decided to go squat in peace, there was no such thing. Of course someone had to come way across the room to do arm curls while I was trying to squat it out. Went to the group exercise room to cool down and noticed they had spin bikes in there as well. From my experience, there's been two rooms, one for each. Did my stretching and left. Solid 2.5 stars. 2 for desk clerk and Mike. Half for convenience, minus two for lack of air near cardio machines.",uHtu4wW3WdygQtNMOmlILQ
1087,"Time: 12:30PM Date: 7/31/15 Weather: Clear and warmI came here with my friend who's getting married in three weeks, to look for bridesmaids gifts. Her mother was with us as well. Upon entering the store, we were not greeting by anyone. Although, there were two employees present on the floor (one associate, one manager). After being in the store for 10 minutes with approximately 10 other people, they continued their conversation on not using text messaging to do business. It wasn't until someone asked to try something on, that they finally broke their conversation. The associate came to help the customer with a bracelet that happened to be by our party. After helping her, my friend's mom proceeded to ask the associate how she could get a piece she has at home, to really sparkle. The associate said she could by a cloth. My friend's mom asked her if they store offered a cleaning service. The associate laughed and said ""No. That's weird."" We asked we that would be so weird, she said because no one has ever asked me that before. We told her, well other jewelry stores, such as Tiffany's do offer the service. So its not really something that you laugh at when someone asks you if your ""fine"" jewelry store provides that type of service. She shrugged it off and walked away. (I'd like to note the associate came up to us scratching her underarm. Who the hell scratches their arm pit in public, no less while working retail?)After a couple more minutes, I simply had to walk outside, because I could feel myself getting extremely upset. I've worked in a retail store part time for over 15 years. The reason why I maintained that job in addition to my full time office job, is because I like interacting with other people and providing excellent customer service. I had a manager of an outlet store say she was a stickler for customer service because she did not want her store to fall into the typical bad service category as other outlet stores. This store was the prototype of what bad customer service looks like. You ignore your customers, belittle them when they ask you a question with an accent and then not accept responsibility when you've made a mistake.I went back to the store after we left and asked Jennifer (the store manager) for her district managers name and phone number. She proceeds to give me her card, stating she'll forward my email to her district manager and she's not allowed to give out her information. Seriously, was I born yesterday? I know she has no intention at all in forwarding my strongly worded email. But at least you all will now know what to expect when entering that store. No one will acknowledge you. Except maybe to make you feel bad about asking a perfectly normal question. Oh and they won't let you buy 6 of an item with a coupon because the coupon only allows 3. Goodness knows, they're raking in the dough from they're ""sparkling"" customer service.",uHtu4wW3WdygQtNMOmlILQ
1095,"Seriously this place is hella rude. I signed my name on their list just to have the manager skip my name and put in one of their ""regular"" customers. Is my money not green?

1097,"I've been to this restaurant a few times for lunch with my Monday/Friday lunch partner on chilly days when craving soup. I've had the chicken jook, the roast duck wonton noodle soup and some chow fun. All was delicious, until this last time I went. Like another reviewer I found a baby roach in my bowl of roast duck soup. Needless to say I wasn't pleased, nor will I be going back. If you don't mind a roach doing the back stroke in your soup, then feel free. But really there's other inexpensive holes in the wall in Chinatown.",uHtu4wW3WdygQtNMOmlILQ
1098,"So after finding out I was going to start a new job and finding a Groupon for Ombre for this salon, I decided to treat myself and take a risk with letting someone dye my hair. When I made the appointment, I asked how long it would take as I had class at 7PM that evening. The receptionist asked what kind of hair I had, I told her I had really curly hair because I'm Black and Chinese. And that I have dark hair. I brought pictures of the type of color I might like because I didn't want something too light. Victoria greeted me and gave me a robe to change into to start my appointment. I showed her the pictures and we agreed on a caramel type color. I did wear my hair pressed to the appointment. She started on my hair and I noticed she was parting my hair from the bottom to the top. I wasn't sure if this was the way ombre was done because this was my first time. After the color processed, she rinsed it out. Instead of having her blow dry and press my hair, I had her blow dry it with a diffuser. She kept touching my hair while trying to dry it. Even after her manager told her not to. You don't touch curly hair when blow drying it! It will get frizzy. And that's exactly what it did. Okay, that's fine, I understand not every one can work with curly hair. So I went into the bathroom and wet my hair a bit so I wouldn't totally look like Mustafa when I left.While in the bathroom I looked at my hair and just thought, ""it looks like highlights, it doesn't look like the pictures I brought. Maybe it'll look different when I press my hair."" The next day I pressed my hair and it still looked like just highlights. Highlights done on the lower portion of my hair and that had missed the front. So I called the salon (Friday) and told the receptionist my concern. Victoria called me back and left a message stating she would call me back the next day to set up an appointment. I finally talked to her on Tuesday. I stated my concern and she said that she did do ombre and that it was the texture of my hair (it being curly) that made it not look right. And that my hair was too frizzy for it to look right. Say huh?? I was totally stunned that she said this because she said she liked it when she was finishing my hair. I said that it wasn't because of the texture and that I didn't like the color even when I pressed it. Victoria said that she didn't know what I wanted done because she didn't think it would look right even if she added more color to the bottom because of the texture of my hair. I had enough of going back and forth with her and just said I would go to another salon. So after spending $89 on the Groupon ($250 value???), $37.50 on her tip, I learned the priceless lesson of not letting just anyone work on my hair. Bottom line, if you have curly hair find another salon. Unless you want to be told your hair is frizzy.",uHtu4wW3WdygQtNMOmlILQ

Not like the awesome Stone Cold Steve Austin way, the ""did y'all just microwave these????"" way. So I called the restaurant to talk to the manger. The employee there said he wasn't there.

We went into this establishment around 7:30/8:00pm to find a line of five people and three others sitting in the dining room, no one had food.

Her bento came out first, the waitress didn't offer a fork so I got up to get her and her son one. They were plastic. Since I was up the waitress decided since I was up I could bring my own food to the table. 6 of the 12 rolls of my sushi combo were california rolls. Like other reviewers have said, the quality of fish wasn't the freshest. Then we played the waiting game for my friends lion king roll.

1175,"An honest review of the Honest Biscuit Sausage Sandwich.  Full disclosure, I have not been inside their location.  This sandwich was ordered from Uber Eats.  In my opinion a good biscuit should be flaky, fluffy, light and buttery.  This biscuit, while enormous and very filling, was hard on the outside, a little dry, dense and crumbly on the inside.  Inside the biscuit was a small Uli's chicken sausage patty, egg and slice of cheese inside the biscuit.  Unfortunately these ingredients were almost impossible to taste because there was so much biscuit compared to fillings.  So you're basically eating an enormous dry biscuit with little flavor.  I wish I could say better since it looked amazing.I think the biscuit could have been good with butter and jam or possibly some gravy to make it moist, but given the option, I would go to the nearest Biscuit Bitch.",3HgHp-SWWhauBxhK7K_skw
1208,"Stopped by for lunch after a hike.  I've been a fan of their Renton location, so I was thrilled when I learned they opened a Issaquah location.  This location is more casual with counter ordering and self service.  You get all you plates, silverware and water at the serving rack.  I ordered a chicken tikka masala, saffron rice, garlic naan and veggie pakora appetizer.  I was disappointed with the taste of the tikka masala, especially being a fan of the Renton location.  This is not the same recipe.  I actually went to the Renton location a few days later to confirm my memory.  The tikka masala was extremely sweet and was hard to palate without the rice and naan.  The chef mentioned the tikka masala is sweet to everyone who came into the restaurant.  If you've gotta to tell people it's sweet, then maybe it's too sweet. Which is too bad because everything else was great.One thing to note is this restaurant is on the pricey side.  The tikka masala is $14.99 and does not come with rice or naan.  If you want rice and naan (really, who doesn't) you're looking at over $20.  That might be fine at a fancy Indian restaurant, but they've positioned themselves as a self-serve takeaway joint.  Not to mention the fact there are several Indian restaurants in the immediate area doing full lunch buffets for around $12.  They do have lunch specials, but that's only on weekdays.They guy at the counter and chef were extremely nice and seem to enjoy engaging with the customers.  The interior is nice, modern and clean.  I hate to leave such a low rating, but If they can replicate the flavor of the Renton location and address pricing, they can easily get a few more stars from me.",3HgHp-SWWhauBxhK7K_skw

1245,"Tried out Ramen Bushi-Do on a Saturday afternoon after a long hike.  For some reason, the entire strip mall was packed, but despite the parking lot being full I was able to get a seat with no wait.The first thing I noticed was the service, while friendly, seems very inexperienced.  As I was being seated, the server asked what I wanted to drink.  I hadn't even sat down or glanced at a menu yet.  After a few mins with the menu I decided on the Curry Tsukemen.  The Tsukemen comes with shrimp and grilled salmon, and me not being a seafood lover, asked if I could substitute the seafood with whatever they wanted.  He told me they could leave those items off, but would not be able to substitute them for anything.  Seriously???  That's the most expensive part of the dish.  I switched up to the Tantanmen instead.  As you're seated you get some complimentary soybeans with soy and vinegar.  Honestly, the beans weren't the freshest and the sauce wasn't very appetizing.  I really don't know what the point of this is.  The tantanmen was alright, but it was missing one of the key ingredients that makes it tantanmen.  The noodles were topped with chopped char siu, not ground pork which is traditional in tantanmen.  This is especially confusing to me as the owner is the same as Dough Zone (I love Dough Zone!), which has Dan Dan noodles on their menu with ground pork!  And chopping up char sui does not do wonders for the meat as you get some slices that are 100% fat. The standout part of the ramen are the homemade noodle.  The are a straight, medium thick noodle with very nice texture.  I found the broth to be on the thick/fatty side.  Ordered the maximum spiciness, came out as at medium.  I give the ramen 3 stars and knock off one star for the service.  Nice to have more ramen options, this one doesn't crack into the rotation.",3HgHp-SWWhauBxhK7K_skw
1277,"I never thought it would happen, but for the first time ever I didn't finish my bubble tea.  In fact I threw half of it away.  Ordered a Thai Tea Smoothie and it was straight up bad.  First of all, by definition, a smoothie should be smooth.  This had baby teeth sized chucks of ice throughout the smoothie.  Second, since it was not blended well and there was hardly any dairy, it didn't have that creamy consistency a good bubble tea smoothie should have.   The tea goes up the straw and the ice stays in the cup.  Finally, the flavor of the tea was not right and whatever they use to sweeten it left a weird artificial aftertaste.  After a while, I just didn't want to drink it anymore.  On top of the bad bubble tea they have a $4 min for credit cards and their drinks are priced conveniently under $4, so you have to buy something else or pay more.  If I'm at Crossroads walking by I might give it another try, but there are too many bubble tea shops that I like in the area to go out of my way.",3HgHp-SWWhauBxhK7K_skw
1342,"One of the more chill places in Fremont.  I like the atmosphere here, (dark but relaxed, unpretentious vibe, good music), however the food is just so so.  3 tacos for $11.  Been here several times and felt the meat was dry and prepared earlier.  No sides, pay for chips and salsa/guac/pico.  So you're looking at spending $20-$25 after tax and tip for a bare bones tacos, chips and a beer meal that's not as good as the taco truck down the street, yet twice the price.  I will say the service is friendly, bartender was cool and the drinks are good.  My friends love this place, so I'll be back, but I'd rather eat tacos elsewhere.",3HgHp-SWWhauBxhK7K_skw

I attempted to hire Loeffler for my case after a recommendation from a friend and colleague, as well as several recommendations online. I assumed that, for a process as time sensitive as evictions, they would return calls promptly even if it was simply to inform us that they would not be able to take on our case. I never received a response, even after following up with the office again. I contacted another firm and an attorney began working with me the same day.

Guess once they find out you're leaving, you are no longer entitled to any form of customer service. What a retention effort!

I sent an email questioning as to why this was, and did not get a response. Today I had the idea to contact them via Facebook, and as I was searching for their page, I discovered in horror that there is an entire Facebook group dedicated to discussing the abysmal service people have received from this company. Anyway, I will be filing a dispute with my credit card company if I do not receive my order this week, or at the very least a timely response to my inquiry.All of this could have been avoided, had I done my research on this company.

But if I were to guess, I'd say this dude has been trained for all of 10 minutes. He made me the wrong sandwich with toppings I said I didn't want. As he awkwardly sang tunes to himself he was unable to remember anything I said for more then 5 seconds at a time. And man, I've got places to be, and this backpack is heavy.

Notice how i said Fairbanks, and not North Pole...those people are animals, and we should build a wall around our fair city, and defend that wall (as the Game of Thrones nerds would say).  I don't know why this made me think of Friar Tuck's, but a review needs an intro, and whats better than trashing the little brother ""city?"" Yeah, nothing.I guess i used the simple analogy because that's what the food was. No frills, and fairly basic. Not that there's anything wrong with that. My pops and I went here one afternoon on our annual visit back to the motherland...a visit where i see which of my friends are still trying to be rap stars, which ones have gotten fat, and which ex-girlfriends ended up with a said man of the North Pole in a marriage that's crumbling. Its all very bitter sweet...just like a fine IPA.  Anyways, we went during lunch, and the place isn't very big, and there were only about a dozen people in the joint. Its nice and clean though, and there are TVs on sports channels to look at. Tip though, maybe turn on the sound on the TVs, and turn off the teen, pop, techno that was blasting.  We're old men looking to drink, and watch sports. The whole music selection is quite confusing. We seated ourselves, and a nice lady took our drink order. I got a local beer from silver gulch that was pretty good. I ordered the Po Boy sandwich, and I forgot what my dad got.  Took a bit for the sandwiches to come out being that it wasn't that busy. I'm ok with that though, cause it gives you a chance at that key second beer. Real drinkers know what i'm talking about. My sandwich came out after said second beer, and it was OK. It was chicken, cajun spices, cheese, onions, in a hoagie roll. It was fairly decent sized. It reminded me of the cheese steaks at Jay Bird's Wing World. More of  cheese chicken sandwich than Po Boy. No sides come with the sandwiches so if you want something like fries you have to order them separately. Kid next to our table had some cheese fries, and they look aight, but who knew you had to order them. How about a bag of chips and a pickle? So, its about $12 for a sandwich and nothing else. Place is ok. Not bad, but not great. Server was nice enough, and the place is clean. Just not anything I'm going to go out of my way to again when I come back into town to judge my old peers.

1682,"About 3 months ago I planned this Paso trip for our 5 year wedding anniversary.  We had been to Paso once before and loved  the great wines and laid back atmosphere.I was so excited to return this year not just to Paso but specifically to Turley, so I'm actually quite sad how things turned out. The truth is one of the four Turley wines is amazing (you taste four and the last Zin is stellar; the other three are just so-so). That last Zin is $48/bottle.But after two trips here (one each year) I've come to the conclusion that the wine staff seems like they are going through the motions. One woman even was slightly rude today.  I made the mistake of telling my husband that Agentina won their game and when my back was turned  (but my ears still worked!) the staff member said  to her colleague ""I wanted to watch the game for myself!""  She was really irked.Man, i felt bad I ruined the surprise but don't be a meanie.  Also um.... Maybe just wait until I'll leave and then talk sh*t about me. I'd never know.I did buy two bottles but won't be back.  I'm so sad.Even my husband said this tasting room seemed different than the others we visited.

Um, she never wrote back.  And I waited over a week for a response. Back down to one star.  NAIL BAR YOU ARE DEAD TO ME.  DO NOT GO HERE.  (The funny thing is if she had only written back I'm sure I would have put this all behind me and written an updated review. I'm not unreasonable, I can forgive.)UPDATE:  The owner read my review and sent me a private message to apologize... That wins some points in my book (hence I added one star back).  She said she will deal with the situation and thanks me for my feedback.Do I give this place a try again?   Well, I live in Evanston, so it is super convenient...

I'm SURE about this review.I have gone here 5 times total (since it is in downtown Evanston and friends always want to go)... and EVERY single time I have been disappointed. The worst offense was when a nail person there tried to convince me I had bad skin and needed to start getting regular facials (of course from HER).  Um, first of all, I didn't ask. Second, that's a lie.  Not to brag, but I know my strengths and weaknesses and I actually have pretty good skin. I've worn sunblock every day since I was born, and I take great pride in my skin care.  It's one thing my friends always compliment me on.   Third, a mani/pedi is suppose to be RELAXING. It's not relaxing to have a lady literally STARE at the pores on your face while giving you a manicure in order to try to guilt trip you into seeing her for a facial. When I got home, I felt so bad about myself I called up a friend to ask ""Um, do I have bad skin and no one is telling me? I feel really ugly right now.""Oh! and the best/sketch-iest part was that this lady was trying to hit me up for facials at ANOTHER salon she works at.  ICK. ICK. ICK.So, the best part is that apparently Nail Bar knows this employee does this and they have yet to fire her!   PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE.(2nd worst offense, I got a wart on my foot... I can't prove it was from here, but it was the only nail place I had visited around the time I got it.)",2wdhN8Y2EJRswvkduFxnOQ
1803,"If you don't want to keep reading my lengthy review- just know, there are many many options in Seattle for great food and drink with wonderful service. This is not, in my opinion, one of them. To start, we had a gift card here and have been meaning to try it for some time. However, the mediocre reviews have kept us from rushing in. We finally decided to come in a Sunday evening around 6. When we walked in, it was quite empty with only a pair at the bar and one table filled. The lone server greeted us from behind the bar and said ""can I help you two?"" I thought this was a rather odd way to greet customers at a restaurant.We were then told where we could sit (not shown to a table). When she finally came over to bring menus and water, she inquired about what we wanted to drink and quizzed us about what we liked and why, and not in a fun ""try something new"" way, but in a ""are you an idiot, I know everything about wine"" way. We settled on wine and then put in our food order. She did bring over two bottles of white for me to pick which glass i wanted, which was very appreciated and maybe the saving grace of the whole meal.  We ordered the beet + smelt salad, the clam dish, and the salmon entree. My husband noticed it seemed to be a one person kitchen and everything was coming out of a wood fired oven. While we waited for the food, the place started to fill up a bit. Our food took 40+ minutes to come out. When it did, the salmon ($28) was the tiniest portion I have ever been served. Maybe 3oz, maybe. With a brothy sauce, 3 tiny (smoked?) oysters, and that's it. It had decent flavor, but it was barely warm. The beet salad was bland, all you could tasted was smoke from the beets and the smelt tasted more like anchovies than smelt. No sauce or dressing on this dish, not even cheese. Served with some sort of green, not sure what though. 10 minutes later, the server came back to check on us. The place had filled up a bit at this point and immediately prior to checking on us she actually turned a table away and sent them elsewhere. I reported the salmon was not hot and she said ""well it came right out of the oven"" which was then even more concerning if it had even been cooked to temp. She offered to have the chef put it back in the oven, but I denied. I asked her to cancel the clams, which took her by surprise (I think because she never put them in in the first place). She immediately brought our check,$66 for two glasses of wine and one salad + auto gratuity ( she did take the salmon off at least ) and said ""I hope you give us another chance."" Well, we will hopefully be back to spend the rest of our gift card on a bottle of wine from their ""wine shop.""But certainly we will not be back for food. This place has a lot of potential and I never want a restaurant to fail, but there are many many options for wine and good food in Seattle and this is sadly not anywhere on the list for me.",hTj02lFMGQveiLBMK-yjfg
1816,"We stopped at Sumomaya hoping to have a drink and some appetizers. We are not from the area, but had heard rave reviews of this place and it was close to our resort. We walked in on a Monday night, and they were not super busy. We like to sit at the bar, but always check in with the host just in case they seat their bar specifically (we know most places don't, but some do, so we always try to be respectful and not just blow past the host stand). The hostess was extremely rude and responded to our request to sit at the bar like we were ridiculous for saying anything to her. We sat down and there were at least 4 people working behind the bar, possibly one in training. Once sitting at the bar we were not greeted, but just handed a drink  menu and asked if we were going to order dinner. We said we weren't sure, but would like to see a menu. Then another bartender comes over and sets down some sort of placemat that were both soaking wet. We ordered a drink, which came quickly, while we looked over the menu. Maybe I was missing something, but i didn't see any sushi on the menu, I'm talking like nigiri or sashimi, which is what we were hoping for as we weren't hungry enough for rolls. I was planning to ask about that, but we finished our drink and not one of the 4 people behind the bar ever came back to check on us or see if we wanted to order anything. By this point we were both feeling uncomfortable and had decided to go. We were able to get the attention of one bartender to get our check at least.

We had heard great things about this place and chose it over the Stephanie Inn to do our big celebratory dinner of the week. Obviously, as newlyweds we were very excited. We walked in to an almost empty dining room and were told to ""pick any table."" I was immediately disappointed there wasn't a table prepared for us. The server acknowledged our reservation, but there was no mention of our honeymoon. We ordered a bottle of white wine, the Anne Amie Pinot Gris, which was delicious, but it was not put in a chiller, just set on our table. No big, but it got warm. We ordered the crab cake appetizer which was very underwhelming and the only way I can think to describe it is as ""stale."" The fresh green salad was apparently grown by the man sitting next to us, and was very good. I ordered the fish of the day (Dover Sole) and my husband got the lamb  (one of the most expensive dishes) as a special treat. The fish was cooked perfectly and I loved the risotto mushroom cake it was served with. However, my husband had a very hard time even getting the lamb off the bone, and there wasn't much meat. He said it tasted ""alright."" My biggest complaint though is that they did not even acknowledge that we were celebrating our honeymoon. As young newlyweds we were SO excited to be eating a ""big fancy dinner"" and just a simple congrats would have meant the world to us. The guy next to us that apparently grew our salad got all 7 courses for free, but they could not even acknowledge our recent wedding (despite us even saying something about it!). Even the chef came out (after we told our server that we were celebrating our marriage) and asked how our meal was, but didn't offer any congrats. Oh, and we were one of two tables left in the restaurant. If all the food had been excellent, it would have been worth it. Or had they managed to acknowledge what we were celebrating, we would have left more stars.  Wish we would have celebrated elsewhere.",hTj02lFMGQveiLBMK-yjfg

The forced measures when they deliver the potatoes, essentially a hostage negotiation for getting the right amount. Diligence as you may have to over communicate the kind of cut you desire. Heaven forbid it is not on the cart. Your cut will mysteriously appear from another room. The salad trick does not really work with already wilted goods. Blah.The fact that Guiness remains on tap could save your meal, but in a world of choices....Lawry's has been passed up. Overall, it was the general unhappiness of the waitstaff and crew.

The staff seemed over extended and during our dinner our requests for simple things like salt, lemon and more cocktails went unheeded for up to 20 minutes each. I choked down my steak with not accompaniments and my friend had to send back the souless sole. Not a word, but replaced by a tasteless pasta.

When I mentioned it the server went into a solid performance about acidity. As a cook I can appreciate the intent, but the heavy hand was rough. The potatoes were rendered uneatable since they were so tart from the strong cheese. My brine pork and beans dish went from delicious one bite to tough mother the next. The beans were chalky and not up to the standard of the locale. The pasta was just rubbery. Al dente for a dorm room not a restaurant. There was no inquiry as to why we left our starters half eaten. Odd. It may have been like speaking to a brainwashed occultist to explain why we did not like 2 of the 3 starters. The plates were just swept away. The olives were great. The cocktails were thoughtful. The straight pours on the Scotch were very cheap and insulting. Not our fave stop on this culinary jump in San Diego.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
1892,I saw the roach in that pic too late. Not much could change the horrible customer service. A place where friendly kids used to work is manned by surly twenty somethings busy on phones. No welcome. No thanks for a $100 order. The food was all greasy and even the pizza which used to be decent was a soggy mess by the time I drove it 4 blocks. This place had its moment...I guess that was in the 90s.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
1893,"A place where we had a host of memories over the years, this place has just kept going down downhill. The sauces no longer have zest. Just bottled sauce sugarieness. Rubber pasta no where near al dente. I know these qualities are open to interpretation and individual taste, but when you deliver an artichoke dip with flavorless bread that needs all the tricks of salt and pepper and chili flakes  you can muster at the table you feel you should find a new place to make new memories.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
1897,"Time to give up. In the horrible food desert that is this area, use your legs or wheels to not go to this Mexican restaurant. It has gone further and further downhill for years. The last visit was our last. Declining quality of food and service were the final hallmarks. We waited forever for service and then were served ""cold"" plates 20 minutes later. No words of apology and they did not even check up on the table. This is a cumulative review of the past 3 visits after years of going here. It is not on our list anymore.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
1898,"I will give this place credit. It keeps some folks employed. That is about it. The Quincy approach to quality is feeling that you don't have much of a choice at the Seattle Center. They are wrong. Kebab and Skillet can provide much better sustenance. Such blah meat, brown lettuce and freezer-burned fries were the takeaway. I was with a little kid and they made the choice. He regretted it right away and did not finish his $9 burger. He made due with a post-Quincy's Subway sandwich which he looked to enjoy. He even asked me why the fries were so mushy and old tasting. The staff was sure nice, but the powers that be have really taken advantage of what they think of as a captive audience.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
1899,"Watch as the Douglas star just burns out and takes downtown Seattle dining with it. For over 16 years I have sent guests, taken guests and been a guest myself at the PK. I just imagine that the great eateries a few blocks away don't exist. That is over. PK is over. The burger, once an innovative delight is now a hackneyed piece of flavorless meat. On par with the junk that Douglas has talked Alaska Airlines into serving in first class. The mushroom hash had to be improved at the table. One guest had fish. We did not bother to ask as she just muscled her way through the experience. Dessert was a savior but came to late in the game. Despite a game and sweet server, this experience will stand as my last in a Douglas restaurant until inspiration re-lights his fire and he begins to innovate again with better results.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
1902,"This used to be a stalwart of the PDX scene, but has taken a precipitous fall. When we lived here we ate there 3x a month. We used it as our place to meet all our PDX friends on our frequent visits. Start with the no-adjustment stance from the kitchen that would not switch out types of potatoes on a meal. Go on to a now indifferent approach to cocktail making. The Manhattans tasted like they were from a can. Go on to the erratic service. (BTW - we were the only diners in the dining room on a Wed night)Finalize with the simple fact that the food was just not as good as it used to be. I was even willing to overlook the preceding items if food was still stellar. It was not. It tasted old. It tasted dated. It tasted like 2001.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
1909,"An interesting location. Not a Hilton Diamond destination. The room staff was great. The front desk staff was ok. High floors have very small prison like windows, but lower rooms get the barrage of all the street noise from construction. Hard to avoid in Boston. The real issue is the lack of amenities at the site. I get that it is an old hotel, but no Executive lounge and Diamond amenities are nil. The attached restaurant is fine but not designed for quick hotel meals or a reasonable breakfast. Even with the $10 voucher from Hilton. A simple Bacon and Eggs plus espresso still cost $46. Not worth it for what you get. I would say the biggest upside was the location of the Wheelhouse 1 block away for the best breakfast sandwich in Boston.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
1919,"The plane is new and nice. The system is lame. From the online experience of trying to upgrade or add (which you need to do for everything) it is insulting. We paid for the Premium on the way to London and it was sub par. Lousy food and 2 drink cart visits over 9 hours. The ride back was about the same without paying a $700 upgrade. Don't be woo'ed by the Lounge access. In London you have to reserve access and they do not give preference to Norwegian customers. The lounge in always overbooked. In Oakland the access to the ok lounge is $45. If you need it pay for that, buy snacks and drinks!! (no water service on board) and take an Ambien. You will not miss any service or amenities.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
1920,"After staying in several Waldorfs and expecting Diamond treatment, I was very disappointed in this stay. To start our room was not up to par for the brand. Even in crowded old London. Almost 0 amenities. We were even moved to a ""better"" room only to get more floor space and 2 beds for 1 couple. I heard the word sorry more times in my 1st hour in this hotel than I have heard in a year of Hilton stays. The beds were hard as rocks. The room cleaners were spotty. My biggest disappointment was the sense that you were just at a hotel. Not a nice Waldorf experience. Gone are the touches like Ferragamo soap, stationary, plush towels and classy amenities. This was just a roadside level Hilton. At over $400 per night it was not just disappointing, but insulting. The staff was very nice, but all they could say was sorry over and over. This does not hold a candle to Rome, Versailles, Arizona, Hawaii or ANY other Waldorf we have visited. A shame and a waste of money.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
1929,"We want it to be so good. After four visits the consensus is meh. The food is ok but nothing spectacular. The burgers have become less and less special. I questioned my drink last visit because I had ordered a Rye Manhattan. The push back was odd and I had not asked for a second one, I just wanted them to know that another customer might be different. All I received for my kindness was rushed rudeness through the end of our last time at Shelter.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
1940,"This used to be a favorite, but it had steadily declined. Mostly due to the service. Over 8 years we have dealt with surly waitstaff and just shrugged it off, but going to the forced march of 20% tip was the death blow. I have never tipped below that amount, but it had removed any incentive for the staff to be attentive and just plain friendly. Seattle has much more to offer than when we started going her 8 years ago. Time for us to cherish our memories and move on.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
1954,"Time dulls memories. This used to be a fantastic meeting place with the wonderful backdrop of insane Time's Square. Now it's a depressing lounge with mediocre drinks, indifferent service and sub-quality food. It this is really part of the Marriott they need to re-consider branding. I had spent many post-meetings here entranced by the view and the service, but lately it has just gone down hill. It's almost a pure reflection of the commercial junk below and is not longer a refuge.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
1963,"Sleep? Ok. Amenities? 0. There were a few friendly staff, but  even if it was $25 a night this is a rip in Vegas. You get hit with the Resort Fee. A pool that does not open until 10am. An understaffed restaurant. If you are Diamond Hilton...expect nothing. The toilet stank. The shower dripped endlessly. Room service that has to call you back to confirm orders 2x. The bar is pretty low and I chose this property because I'm a Hilton brand loyalist. This stay tested my limits.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
1974,"Driven by desperation I read the menu quick and thought I saw salvation. The first form of the salvation was a Guinness. The second was a ""grilled"" cheese sandwich with bacon and soup. MMM. NOT. It was toast with cold cheese, hard bacon and you need to pull it off tomatoes. Not a grilled cheese. The stew was flavorless pap that needed Tabasco to even swallow. Really a low bar to hurdle for travelers and these guys did not make it over. The Guinness had a silver dollar head on it. Really a cheesy move.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
1975,"Each year Campo slides further downhill. Now at a point where the food is catering to the Buca di Beppo crowd. I was surprised how far the quality of the food fell. The hostess was openly hostile to anyone without a reservation. We overheard her over and over again since we sat at the bar near the front. It was amazing. In a small community like that you should be humble and have other suggestions. Especially for first night families. This is not an exclusive place. This is not Beverly Hills. From that we made our way through some tepid cocktails, blah apps, a pasta dish with literally no flavor and a pizza that was soaked in the middle. No one ever asked how our meal or drinks were. Now you know.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
1980,"You are not left with a lot of premium chain options in Mammoth, so this is it The average rooms are cramped and ill advised for multiple parties. Storage is at a premium. A hint. Use the ski check at the bottom of the gondola so you save your back and time. The staff was ok. Usually pretty curt. Not very professional when you called down. The restaurant can be a timesaver, but the less than average service really makes you question your decision. There are some Westin touches and as a Gold I did not get to enjoy many amenities. There was no consultation at check in. No extras. No late check out. Like I said at the start, you are limited. If you don't mind $400 a night for a sub par experience then go for it. Or rent a place. (much better)",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
1989,"Nightmare. Location is next to a bar where you can hear ALL of the noise. Music, pool table, loud voices etc. This is not a sanctuary or serene location. The staff looks at you blankly and wants pre-payment. All I wanted was a good post golf massage. The lady who started my massage took off her shoes and her feet stank as she walked on my back. I bit back my bile and forced through. Then the doorbell began. I was switched off to other workers and left for 10 minutes at time. On the third event I just left. You got my $, but hopefully you don't get anyone else to fall into this nightmare trap.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
1991,"Really bad for an executive lounge. Over three nights I never was able to get breakfast due to the hoards of children. During Happy Hour the bartender was gone most of the time and outside of the wasabi peas the food was pretty terrible. Very lax and not executive in any sense. I get it that it is Orlando, but just a little more consideration for adults would be nice.I still don't understand how I can only bring one adult guest yet someone with kids can bring 5.This Hilton is off my stay list.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
1999,Read the reviews and was dumbfounded at the low quality mess we had for lunch. As usual we over ordered just to be able to try different items. Jerky like low quality beef was the first surprise on the pancake. Under-cooked steamed dumplings. The grossest and greasiest presentation of green beans ever!Even the pickled eggs were so bad we tasted and dropped them. There was no questions asked as most of our food went untouched. I read the other reviews and I'm too shocked. This was not quality and this was not just a step down from DTF and the others. This was just plain bad. When you go 0 for 7 on ordered dishes you know it's bad. To top it off they had only one source of heat. A dried up can of the old Sambal style hot paste. I had to re hydrate it with soy sauce. If this is your place you are welcome to it. Really disappointed.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2002,"20 years of going to El Gaucho and it's branded restaurants. Cigar lockers, room rentals, special events and more that 50 private dinners. What's happened? The last 3 visits have been severe disappointments and I could not bring myself to believe it the last 2 times, but our visit last Friday cemented that the brand has taken a hit. The service is not the sterling and attentive one on one of old. Attention to detail has floundered away. This last visit required me to GO find our server 2 times. Not once were we checked on for the quality of our meal. (When you order 2 lobster tails you want a little check in).The so-called sommelier was non-interactive. It was like being at Robot Restaurant in Tokyo for all he added to the experience. The quality of the food is still fine, but not sublime like in years past. To top it off the sundae was not the treat of old, but something that belonged on the menu at Cheesecake Factory. Maybe this is now the target. The view remains great....beyond the table. The El Gaucho era is obviously over. Back to Canlis.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2011,"Something is always missing here. You can't be blamed for weather conditions, but you can hire better staff. You can groom runs better. You can offer better and cleaner amenities. This is not a resort, but at the prices you pay for such limited runs it should be made up for with better maintenance. This is a great place with limited time for night skiing, but full price full days here are out of the question.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2013,"Nice and attentive staff. The rolls were ok, but not inspired like the long lines imply. It is simple sushi at high prices. The nigiri was presented very dry for the pieces we chose. On this second trip I have decided to try other places. The uni was so unsavory I had to gulp it down and beer chase it.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2014,"If you get stuck at the tower, expect Meh. There is NO executive lounge. Room service has to come ACROSS the street so don't do it. The pool area is really bleachy and not an inspired spot to swim.The rooms are average even after an upgrade. Nothing special. What you'd expect. The desk staff is very disinterested. While waiting for a friend I watched 10 guest walk through the lobby without a greeting. This extended to us as well. Calls to the front desk were routed to the other building so we gave up on a screaming woman complaint.  While under construction don't pay more that $89 for this hotel. I've given them a lot of chances in the last year, but I will just stay elsewhere until they fix these issues. As a Diamond member I expect more.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2019,Rude. Non helpful. You are a walk in store not a high caliber design house. Know your place in the world.  A waste of time and effort that makes me resent all my previous purchases here and with this brand.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2020,"Duped by the funny commercials, I tried this place after driving by for years. I'm guessing the service and food is better in other places of the country, but between my small hamburger and hotdog I could not find a tasty bite. Cold on both counts and oddly flavorless. The drive-thru service was long and horrible. 16 minutes with only 2 cars ahead. Even the much anticipated Lime-Ade was so watered down with ice you would have thought I was ordering during a heat wave in Texas. Altogether a bad one off experience. Local clients made fun of me for going afterwards saying they avoid this place at all costs. Meh.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2040,"A cumulative response. We have eaten here several times. At first we were overjoyed to have a choice in this crummy area of Seattle for food choices. The burgers were well presented and the staff was ok, but that just started to turn on each visit. The last one was the clincher. Non-service is the best explanation. We had mentioned a movie time and were not asking for 15 minutes, just 30 to get our food. The response and what we received was the tail end of our diminishing visits. Half cooked burgers, water never filled, second rounds of drinks never taken. We had to go to the front just to pay our bill to get out of there. I did not look for a manager, but you would think the sight of four people rushing to get of your establishment might be a concern. It was not a busy night, there were only 6 full tables. I can now tell folks to move on over to RN74 for a downtown snack.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2046,Diminishing returns. We are now down to one star after such a stellar start. We have taken several friends here and we have enjoyed our visits up to the first 8 times. Lately not so much. I feel very bad for the owners since they have such a quality menu and tasty cider but they hire the worst staff.  People who do not recognize you despite repeated visits. Today was the final straw in a near empty (one table inside one out) we sat there for eight minutes waiting for any attention.  All the things  I liked before have diminished over these last three visits to the point that they are off my list. Invest in good staff and you will reap the benefits. Allow indifference and horrible turn over and you can't build a clientele.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2056,"Dozens of meals here with my crew. The pork chop and more and then two in trips in a row we get the worst service and small bugs throughout our salad. The response was to scrutinize the salad and not just whisk it away. We asked for NOTHING. On top of that the bartender who is expecting was full of attitude and really brought this once stellar place and brand down into the can. She quoted a server's manual when asked for service. The management response was so odd, after dropping literally thousands of dollars here over the last few years I will make it my mission to let all my friends and partners know that this is not the Perry's we used to love. This is a huge letdown and I had to let this happen 2x before I responded on Yelp.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2058,"If you need a room for a night before a cruise and you are NOT a Diamond Hilton member, this is your place. All others expect poor service from the management, yet sweet and helpful service from the restaurant and maid service. As a Diamond there is no option for upgrade and this management team seemed prideful of that fact. A poor introduction to on site amenities and very bad scheduling at the pool side service. This was my third stay here due to business, but the last and I will take my business closer to the beach or downtown.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2060,"You're stuck. Basically if you want to play Fosters you have to get your snacks here. The bar service is always inconsistent and too much attention is paid to the regulars. Food turn around time is getting worse and worse. The food has always been marginal at best, but my group's last round resulted in an undercooked chicken sandwich and a soggy burger. When we mentioned it the server said the kitchen was really backed up and that replacements could take 20 minutes. Great when you have a tee time. Pack a sandwich. You will be better served.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2061,"A stay of utter desperation and geography. This was my latest stay where the TV did not work and the staff did not answer the calls to the front desk. On the way out I mentioned it and there was little to no reply. As a Diamond, having to ASK for the low end amenities of the water and bag of chips is demeaning. Getting tired of real low rent Hilton experiences this year. If you are in the area, drive a little further up the road for more choices.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2062,Disorganized and pretty much the bottom of a bottomless list of mediocre experiences with this brand..Cookies ordered not put in bag with 5 lunches today was just the tip.  Had to repeat simple order 3x and then waited 12 minutes for a coffee. Now I know to make the stop in Tacoma not this location.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2080,Meh food at best. The Carne Asada had no flavor to go with the flavorless rice and beans. Asking for the tomatillo salsa added nothing g but green to my plate.  Service was so spotty that I actually fantasized about Chipotle efficiency.  The person that seated us walked around in a daze until I jus t picked a table.  The Tijuana Ceasar had been sitting there for hours or was really just that horrible.  Diet coke was even flat.  My other visits have been just as bad but Tequila tempered it.  When my companion boxed her lunch and then it was left on the table I had my answer in her experience.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2085,"The location is great for downtown fun, but the amenities when it comes to Diamond members are poor. The valet parking is $50 per night which seemed high when I checked the other properties. As a Diamond guest I was never afforded the basics and had to fight for at a minimum a higher floor per my reservation and status. There is no executive lounge so the ""free"" breakfast is a patchwork of poorly chosen fruit, stale bread and some nice little croissants. As someone who lives in Hilton properties, I have to say I was unimpressed with the whole experience as a Diamond member. As a standard stay I would only suggest the property for baseball fans. The onsite restaurant for seafood was half empty and we were told we had to wait up to half an hour. That is when we took all of our activities off property.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2088,Diminishing returns. After 30 years these last two visits were the worst. Poor help is coupled with disorganization. Bringing entrees first. Appetizers without the bread. The worst crime is the lowered quality of the meat. Lamb beef and chicken. This last time was with a group that had good memories from college that were dashed.  The staff is nice but inefficient.  How a tandoori dish can be ready in 6 minutes makes me suspicious and the meat was very dry.  Last time for this place that did good meals for years.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2089,Really a letdown on a street of good eateries and bars.  Deceptive NO cornbread sandwiches is only the start.  No apologies for the deception. The quality of the food was poor with cheap bacon and old lettuce. The cardinal sin of bringing the appetizer with the meal was not even acknowledged.  Waiting for cutlery and having to retrieve our own drinks was the end of this lousy experience.  There was no surprise when the server took away our barely eaten plates. This place is a must miss and it was not even crowded.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2095,Nice selection of beers but not much else. We were a group of 4 so we had a chance to try many different items that all pretty much was blah. The burger meat was flavorless and the fact that curry had to be a part of so many dishes should have been a warning to blandness. Even food in London is not this meh anymore. We really needed to shake off a rainy day of golf but the indifferent service left us with one round of drinks until the server came back to ask about dessert after we had given up on the meal. Side note..one of our buddies was in the line for McDonald's as we were leaving.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2100,"Corporate cowardice and thievery. To allow guests to get up on the mountain each day only to literally close the place down over weather. This was not a one day experience, but multiple days where they did not honor the contact inherent in the $125 lift ticket. Skiiers take the risk. Waited 3 years for this place to get snow and this is what you get. Go anywhere else but here if you are in the area. International travelers be warned that this could be a huge waste of money, travel and time. It's so bad that the locals actually just take it in stride and seem to expect these activities. They should shut the whole place down in the morning and not gather up the $$ then basically funnel them off the mountain. Poor management and borderline criminal. Heavenly you are OFF the list of ski destinations forever.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2101,"Really lousy food and too much preference for locals. After a day of skiing you deserve better than overcooked hotdogs and indifferent servers. Our two tables had to flag down servers for everything from menus to water to more beer. It may have been an off night for the establishment, but no reason to go back and give them another try.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2102,Horrible service on our visit and even worse was the greasiest vegetarian dishes I have ever seen. The response when I pointed out how greasy the cauliflower dish was absolutely dismissive. Dirty tables with food in all the knots made this a really bad experience. We had heard a few good things about this place so we were disappointed to say the least.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2108,"A novice only spot. Heavy on rolls, slow on service and really not well presented nigiri. I was hoping for something better for my friend's intro to sushi, but the rolls were too pasty and the CHUNKS of fish were not masterfully presented. When are places going to learn to not cater to the Chili's and all you can eat crowd. Sushi is meant to be delicious slices of pure protein, not hacked chunks. You can get that in a can.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2112,"A hot mess of an airport with some of the worst food and service choices for a big city airport. The layout is odd, the drop off area an afterthought nightmare and getting around is not intuitive at all. I really can't stand flying through here. It's almost...almost worth it to drive down from Austin and fly from there.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2115,"After years of extolling the virtues of this chain, it has fallen off the cliff. What was once cripsy crust and tangy sauce has been transformed into cardboard crust and sugary sauce. A huge mistake to cater to the Pizza Hut crowd, but that is what happens when you over extend a brand, too many stores and not enough love. Really sad turn of events. My group of 6 tried all kinds of slices so this review is not based on one slice or one visit.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2116,"I really don't know what this place is going after. The food was pretty terrible and they Wagyu beef was abused. My wife's chicken pot pie was a crust over a can of Creamy Chicken Chowder ala Chunky Soup. The staff seemed nice, but our server stunk like cigarette and MJ after she returned from her break. Kind of gross when you are eating and you're not getting baked in someone's living room. We cancelled dessert and beat a hasty retreat. The location is unique so I hope the get the food straightened out.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2122,"Expectations were sky high for this stop. The staff was excellent and friendly. The sheer number of people there gave me hope, then the food showed up. Very bland. I was not looking for anything HOT, just tasty. We tried hummous, lamb and several dishes in the hope that we may have just ordered wrong, but this was food designed for the blandest palate. If those folks exist then they should enjoy the quality of the food which was very good. The flavors are what was missing. After eating in several Persian restaurants I know not to expect the spices of Lebanese or even Israeli food but something to bring this up in the flavor category. They even brought a spicy sauce that did nothing to bring up the taste quotient. Even the house pickles were just vinegary with no enhancement.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2133,"These stores are pretty standard, but after 4 visits I have to say this is the one is pretty confused. It may be a training location and that would be fine if they let us know. This one is always near my hotel and it's always the same. I get that it's busy, but they need to train the folks a little better to live up to all the other ones in the city.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2135,"The good first. The breakfast is a step above average DoubleTree fare. The staff is indifferent, but the buffet is well stocked and the omelette bar is a good day starter. Know where you are before you book. If you are uncomfortable walking around an area full of city denizens, this is not your place. You are at least a few block walk from any entertainment or food choices. Especially after dark. The lobby is a mish mash. The Starbucks is hidden and the workout facility is kind of poor. There is no pool and no executive suite. As a Diamond Hilton member there was no incentive for me to stay here. I was not greeted as a Diamond member and I was not given an upgrade despite there being several rooms available for upgrade according to Hilton Customer Service. The front desk staff is pretty indifferent to customers. I watched quite a few interactions and although they were not rude, they were not quite Hilton level either. To top it off, the micro-bathroom layout is getting old in these DoubleTree conversions. Really not worth anything over $150 per night.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2140,"The nightmare place of all nightmares at a huge cost. Even if you are a die hard who needs to ride roller coasters find some other place. Superman and Batman are still excellent rides, but not worth the hassle. One line to buy tix, one line for security and then a line to get into the park. THEN you try to get a Flash Pass. The ultimate scam and nightmare. A dumb system that requires you to carry around an Tomiguchi style pager where you have to reserve your next ride. Cool right? No. It's designed to make you run around the park getting concessions as you try to stay cool and get to the next Reservation. Add to that you are a salmon running upstream to use your GOLD pass looking like a jerk as people are getting off the rides. That's right! There is no dedicated line for your extra $50 to $125 pass. You basically have to sneak in the back door. Worst yet. Finding out there is no actual 1 hour wait at the ride and you could have just normally stood for 15 minutes and gotten on the ride. The place is filthy with the Superman ride looking like it's an ash planet not an ice crystal planet. There is old debris everywhere and you still have to climb that big hill to get across the park or up to Superman. Really a downer and disappointment. A place I would visit every five years has no become a place I will tell everyone not to visit. Ever.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2142,"The front desk person (single!) was nice but did not know anything about the property or local info. They did not greet me as a Diamond member and there were surely no amenities in line with my status. They were even out of cookies. We were told room service was open until 10pm. I called 5x between 915 and 925 with no answer. We had to scramble into town to get a late dinner. The pool was nice, but you had to hunt down towels inside a dank and depressing lobby. In fact all the lobbies in this labyrinth were dank like the middle of ski season. It is August!Free parking and spotty internet were the only perks. NOW the WORST part. They had a person in the guise of a concierge who waylaid us each time we ended up in the lobby with a proposal to check out Hilton Vacations. Every time. We ran out of decent ways to put him off. This is not how I want to spend my vacation days, getting attacked in my own Hilton lobby. They have a long way to go to live up to better Hilton property names. As a caveat, I did call down to talk with a manager that night and the next morning and received no call back or apology.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2148,This is a composite review of a few visits. Once again people are deluded into this IDEA of a place and the one off hipsters have embraced a joint that fails to deliver on the basics. When you leave the vinegar soaked poached eggs in a dish you essentially ruin the entire dish. The cheese grits were at best unmemorable and the gritty fatty andoulille sausage was an add on insult. The odd attitude of a take it or leave it server capped the last visit to this place. My wife can have it. Where I was impressed before by the happy hour menu I am now puzzled by the foolishness of standing outside on the street to get in here. The potatoes that accompany dishes look straight from Oreida.  Most disappointing was the Bloody Mary. Bland to a fault.  If you are in the neighborhood go to Tin Lizzy.  You Will Be Treated better.  Out table and booth were filthy as well. See pic.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2152,"This was delivery, so maybe I missed the ambiance of the restaurant. This was close to being the most meh Jersey pizza I have ever experienced. The surroundings of the Extended Stay America that the cheap company put me up in was bad enough, but the bland choice of rubbery mozzarella, the stale risotto ball and the limp crust on the pizza ensured I would never seek this joint out for a follow up meal. The salad was good and the house dressing was well balanced. After that, I just kept walking by the 3/4 of a pizza and 3/4 of risotto ball regretting my decision to not just get in the car and eat out.  I was jealous every time I saw the Domino's guy roll up throughout the night to serve the rest of the prisoners at the Extended Stay.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2155,Now officially in the toilet of airlines.  They can't keep these aging junk heaps in the air and the Spokane Seattle flight is delayed every time I'm unlucky enough to miss the jet at 2:15.LOUST non professional response is always delivered by the staff here.This is getting old. Especially when you can see SW flights coming and going no problem.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2156,The baristo working this afternoon has undone all dozen previous visits with his lousy attitude. This will never be a coffee stop for me and my friends ever again.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2158,A gruesome third world airport without the charm of a better exchange rate or exotic food. I finally found the tunnel that connects terminals 4 to 6 so not a total loss and the other terminals are zoos but with better shops and food than terminal 6.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2159,"The staff is always pleasant and this is more of a judgement call against the board room.  Why are there children here and people with fake service dogs?This is supposed to be a quiet haven away from the riff raff to rest and do some quiet business. Now it is more like a daycare or after school program with sullen teens making graveyard mixes like they are at ampm.For all the things that Alaska has taken away from customers, I always imagined this as the latest bastion of peace and decency. Apparently it has joined the no blanket, minimum service, lousy food ethos of the rest of this once terrific airline.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2160,"This is based on 12 diminishing visits. This place started clean and has really gone down hill with cracked vinyl and bad smells. 4 massages were superb. Only one good one was done by a guy.  All the men stink of nicotine and their last meal. Knowing this I started putting menthol in my nose before visits. Today's massage.. my last one here was interrupted by phone answering and was accompanied by a rotting vegetation smell that would not go away. It was a guy doing the massage. One of the least inspired. He was not intuitive like others had been. The ladies always did a good consistent job but this place needs to step up the cleanliness and quit cutting corners. Also, invest in some incense at a minimum.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2164,I really expected more history. The guides are very nice fun people but are always shucking for the other tours. The point of the tour is more interesting than the reality. The history of what actually happened is obviously more nuanced and deserved a little more attention. This is a Seattle institution and I like to support it but they should really spice it up.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2173,"Really a let down. Run down and a bit dirty in all the spots I saw. The folks are nice in a generally southern way, but it does not make up for the lack of amenities on site. Especially when the airport is known for delays. They should add more restaurants and massage etc.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2177,"Pretty much a must miss. The Dennys of seafood, the only saving grace was the amber beer on draft. Nice wait staff in the general nice New Orleans way but the Crawfish were gray and stunk. The broiled crab claws came hidden in a bowl of butter and the po boy was so much bread to filling that we could have kept a family of ducks alive with it. Really odd. The buttermilk dressing was good but all else was a miss.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2180,Still the worst staff. Is it Lake City? Slow and inattentive  I don't know how the nice food gets made. It takes up to 10 minutes to get coffee. Proves my wife is a saint since she waits,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2183,"This is a composite review from different visits. Number one... however local it seems, this is a tourist trap. Often stinks like urine and never sure if that's on the floor or wafting from the bathrooms. The service is completely indifferent with an odd ""honey"" or ""sweety"" thrown in without much conviction. The drinks are pretty tight pours even at night. The food? In this beautiful city of options, don't eat here. The sweaty quality of the food is what I imagine Kerouac had to eat on the road. So basic and tasteless that you would need tabasco to revive the ""potatoes"". The hash had literal gobs of fat just sitting there. Budget travelers always get taken in here, there are better places. This is a place to check off your list with a short pour whiskey, a FB check in and a quick move on.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2190,Nice waitress and tangy tasty sauce are the pluses. The boiled beef brisket and chunky pulled pork were a let down.  Cornbread in a BBQ joint should be a hunk not a muffin with a wrapped pat of butter. There should be a vat of warm honeyed butter at the minimum. Invasive and oniony coleslaw was another distraction along withe the 3 cloves of garlic on the grilled artichoke. Artichokes do NOT need that level of zest which was overkill Looks like a nice selection of booze. This was a clear headed one beer lunch.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2191,Ironic that across the street from headquarters they have hired the worst crew of any of these places. If you can't handle talking with people go dig ditches or work making pottery.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2192,"However I would love to love this place, the staff and the lack of respect for golfers just brings it down to a two. I have played over 40 rounds here so the review is cumulative. It starts with the blasé people behind the counter. Could they care that you are there to play golf? No. Everything seems like a hassle to them. Advice on how the course is playing today? No one has ever seemed to play the course where they work. Belligerent and often angry maintenance crews interrupt play as a right of way. I have played at the crack of dawn and tried to outpace the mower and then had to do the same at sunset. There used to be a really nice lady who worked in the kitchen. She is gone. Today while waiting to buy something with 4 other people in line, the person working came out mid transaction and filled up her cup with diet Coke and then went back into the back. Leaving 3 of us standing there. It's NINE hole. I get it. But the potential is so much greater and could be a much better experience if they hired new staff and kept people around who love to share the love of golf. It's like going to an ice cream store and being stared down by an angry worker. You are there for fun. Make it fun.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2193,"This is the customer service. ""Excuse me. This tuna sashimi is cut really thick (like tongue!!)""Answer - ""Oh. Ok we cut it thinner next time you come in"" Ha Ha Ha. Next time!??This place is for people who don't know sushi. Sadly it was the only place we could find downtown and the reviews were misleading. If you have never had sushi before and all you eat are rolls covered in mayo and sauce then this may be your place. If you seek out sashimi or nigiri then you best move on. We tried 8 different pieces and to cap off the lousiness of the preparation we were served the most rubbery Ebi I have had outside of a vending machine in Japan. WAIT. That Ebi was much better. I still can't get over the response to the sashimi question. No adjustment or replacement. Just a promise for a visit that will never happen. I hope enough people read this review to put them off this experiment. It was the equivalent of sushi Panda Express. Spend your money on slots and a hot dog instead.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2195,So many times I have tried to give this place a shot. Ice machine on 5 floors broken. Treadmills broken. 2 of 4 elevators functional. A nightmare lobby full of vagrants. A restaurant with delusional prices and horrible food.  Bathrooms with mold and mold on the moulding in the room. Bathrooms so small you really have to shut yourself in to operate and there is no ventilation. The staff does not really care. Mention any issue and it is treated as par for the course. This review is not based on just this last and final stay. I have been here over 5 times with hope that it will scrape the bottom of my Sheraton expectations.  Nope.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2196,"After all the commercials I expected a cut above the buffet, but did not get it. The staff was pleasant, but as a ""destination restaurant"" this place fell short. The nearly desiccated fish in the front cooler should have been the first sign. Choice of oysters was nice and the presentation was fine. Described as Lobster between slices of heirloom tomatoes and mozzarella, the appetizer turned out to be some weird lobster salad that I would not have ordered had it said lobster salad. Really sad and tasteless. Ribs were ok, but the quality of the meat was not sit down restaurant worthy. More like food truck level. The filet mignon was over cooked with no char. Desserts were disastrous with a chocolate cake that was hot pudding and a cobbler that had a 90 bread to 10 fruit differential. To the server's credit she took it off the bill when she saw I took one bite.I get that it is a casino restaurant, and this is where anyone who has a little luck looks to treating themselves, but it really falls short. Feeling bad for people who actually think this is good food, but if Chili's and Applebee's are your standard it may seem a step up. It is not. Just gamble and drink. You can eat on the way home.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2197,The only reason I use Panera is for work. The only plus has always been the lack of a TIP jar. This location has one and that's enough to ensure I don't call in any more orders.  The food is standard but the odd number of workers buzzing around and doing everything but helping at the register added to the wait time.  Not a fan.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2198,The downhill slide is still active. The food is still OK but not legendary.  The staff is absolute junk.  Gone are the days of sterling or golden service.  Murky ugly little women are skulking around with vocal problems about life and customers.  Pull the plug on this establishment. The end has come and gone.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2199,Subpar for a board room. Freaks live for free soup and jostle for it.  Pathetic set up for the flagship location. Minimal amenities and overcrowded. It makes a paid stop at Ivars look brilliant.  Staff is usually nice.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2203,"After 17 years of special celebrations, client dinners and those magical years of the cigar box and bar, El Gaucho may have bottomed out. Starting with the Denny's level ""hostess"" it went odd after that. Instead of the professional approach from year's past, the waiter was extremely casual and a bit dismissive. Since I've dined here for years we knew what we wanted quickly but had to wait a long time for even the drinks order. After that it was like a land rush. Our appetizers barely landed when the Caesar salad show started. I don't know when they changed to such a sweet basalmic vinegar, but it is a mistake. It takes away the tart contrast and reduces what made the salad so special. The wicked shrimp were the wicked shrimp thankfully. My wife enjoyed her butterflied filet and my Steak El Gaucho was fine, but not the sublime greatness that has driven me to the restaurant for years. The portion of lobster would not even satisfy the smallest appetite. The bizarre and kind of useless addition of the Sundae presentation was a non-starter. Stick to the classics. If you are hurting for business it is because you have alienated too many of us old school El Gaucho lovers. I have defended you for the last few years, but may finally have to cave. Please don't reduce this place to a drinks and apps stop. Seattle needs you at your former glory best.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2205,Run by belligerent and ugly trash. Unless you are on fumes move on to the Texaco. Unfriendly staff and disgusting humanity lurking outside. I would never let my wife get gas here. Give your money to anyone else.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2207,"After the deli, we were really looking forward to dinner here. Outside of the olives, everything was underwhelming. Overly done pasta on the one plate and a critically undercooked pork chop on the other. The waiter was a little off putting and so we just suffered through the meal paid the toll and vowed never to go back. Add to the insult, my wife was violently sick when she got home. Not our best Bainbridge moment.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2211,Nice service. Really poor food. Thin tortilla chips added to sweet salsa makes it a bad start. Smelling the fish dishes on other tables sinks you a little lower. Having to customize a burrito to a point of being edible was rough. To cap it out no Mexican beers on tap and the knuckle sized glob of fat in my burrito was addressed with a little frown. Sorry Vancouver. You have to roll into PDX for some flavor.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2212,"Food....Great! In the barren wasteland of Edmonds this is a real culinary find. Why the two stars? Service. It has to kill the owners to know that they are doing almost everything right behind the scenes, but they are hard pressed to hire anything but mindless zombies to patrol the floor. Questions go unanswered. No sense of interaction with the customer. Each table is left on it's own to a fault. The ultimate expression of this was getting caught in a rain squall on Friday night on the patio. Not one employee came out to check on us or move us inside. It was downright odd. Until they remedy this, I will take my clients and friends for other food experiences. Our friends who joined us were semi-regulars who said the treatment was not out of line with previous experiences. Sad...but really good calamari.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2214,Service on par with burger King.  A waste of 20 minutes and off to better pastures as we watched customers get ignored and overheard complaints about the food.  This was round two for us. Hence the knockout 1 star blow.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2216,"A silly nightmare location that actually makes Subway look good. I've have yet to meet or talk to staff as dumb as this. That includes trips all over the country. Only hoping they were NOT university students. The world has no chance if they are entering the world in 2-4 years. Sub par ingredients, lousy staff and kind of junky prices. You are better off with a cellophane wrapped surprise from Safeway. Sample question...""Is the chicken white meat?"" Response ""It's chicken."" YAY!!!!",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2217,A claustrophobic nightmare location to be stuck at for even 10 minutes extra. No food selection. Oddly passive aggressive TSA. Literally nothing to keep you distracted or occupied. They ought to let the barber lady on this side of the bars since that is where you end up spending your nightmare minutes. I'm a city boy so I won't go into my rants against non-military camo wearing yahoos. See FB for more details. Needless to say this is a place where you end up endlessly fascinated with the comings and goings of planes outside that window. As an Alaska passenger you get the extra screwing of the endless walk to the rental car counters. Would not do it if I did not have to do it for work.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2219,Hello!? Out of tomatoes was the way this non-starter kicked off. After walking by a dozen times we dove in to enjoy the menu and some drinks. Chili Verde really not so good. Padron peppers were the size of banana peppers. They obviously did not read the manual or go to Spain. Mixed chicken in the green enchilada??? No thanks. The cigarette smoking cook who went back to the kitchen without washing his hands?The warnings about stealing the copper mugs?The indifferent waitress?Not much fun and so we hoofed it out of there to better pastures.....,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2220,"Based on the standardization of the brand, it took a lot for me to bring this down to 2 stars. Especially since I live in these places. 1. Two of the desk people were very sweet and pleasant. The one that worked the night of the 25th of July was horrible. Rude and unhelpful to the worst degree. She ignored a little 4 foot tall old woman for over 5 minutes as she spoke on the phone with a friend. Then she told me to look up restaurants on the internet for suggestions. 2. The cleaning crews really like to bang things around. I had to work from my room and had to listen to bashing on the floor above, the walls next and on my door despite the DO NOT DISTURB sign. 3. The worst breakfast setup of any Hampton yet. Slimy pineapple! Lumpy oatmeal. Out of date yogurt. Really a downer that will force me to fore go Hilton points on the next trip and try the Red Lion or Holiday Inn.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2221,"Poor Walla Walla. Based on the busy flow, people really don't have much choice here. The potato salad was super blah! The Reuben was so oddly cooked it was like the cheese had been cooked days before the rest. The so-called Enchilada soup is a nightmare concoction that only those who live on TV dinners would call good or great. The cookie was nice and the two treats I took for a friend turned out ok. Turns out it is a good bakery, but should leave the food part behind. I was asked to use them as a caterer for an office lunch....I'm really not happy about that. The cashier was nice, but the unfriendly wierdos that brought the meals around were a real downer.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2226,"Ok, qualifier we were there for FIFA and happy hour. More like happy sour. Plenty of drinks to choose from, but literally only pizza and salad until 5pm? If I had seen that and not been off washing my hands I would have left for greener pastures. The salads that we ordered were over saturated with dressing. Overlarge leaves of lettuce that forced a messy cutting. The pizza was...there. Nothing special no pop or special kick. The only upside was that is was thin. OK. We were in the bar so service can be expected to be spotty, but to never check on the meal and to have to wave staff down for salt and pepper is annoying. The kicker is that they were not crowded. Plenty of time to check on patrons in this situation. The fact that this is connected to the gym that I have despised for years was extra incentive to be highly aware of what they were trying to pull. Another case of the half hearted Ballard push. They keep cramming whatever they can into Ballard to take advantage of the popularity but the quality is just not there. I read other reviews and expected better, but other's expectations just must be pretty low.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2230,"When you need so many options for your burger...the meat usually ain't that great. A party of 8 and no one was raving about the meat. They liked the avocado! I liked the avocado!Service was a little confused with requests for water taking 10 minutes and a few wrong orders. I did not experience the bar and that may have taken the edge off my dislike for my burger, but in this day and age if you can't deliver some decent French fries, don't bother. The steakhouse fries they served were mushy and seemed right out of an Oreida bag. Go to Umami for burgers. Go here for beer.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2232,"Avoid if you can....but we have no choice.  Summer is the worst.Food choices have gotten better over the years, but not varied or reflective of the Pacific NW diversity. Getting around can be confusing for many and the randomness of the security area shut downs is always a joke. Too many TSA at one point...not enough at another. They could show them how to use an Excel sheet to see averages for flow, but the airport is in the dark ages for convenience. The North Security used to be the bane since that is where they trained. Now it is better, but another gate suffers. The massage bar is still a pretty good oasis. Don't judge the masseuse by their size. Like little Yodas I have been surprised.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2238,Flavorless food with a surly cashier. Not a fun experience being g yelled at and scowled at while trying to figure out ordering system.  3 empty ketchup bottles on table.  Not good.Not sure why I ended up here besides laziness. I really did not like the flavor of the meat and without a winning combo of sauces you can't hide lousy meat.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2248,Pretty gross tip begging here. Tina cuts hair but Tina asks for tip and reminds you about tip over and over. Tina decides not to give proper change and pockets even more tip. Tina has an absurd idea that pushing her old boobs into your arm and head will induce bigger tip.  Tina is gross. To boot. Tina's idea of head massage is to irritatingly rub conditioner for four minutes. Tina can't even properly operate the shears.  Tina leaves long hairs all over. Big tip to you........avoid this place and Tina.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2253,So...another sad affect of getting too big and losing focus. Do I like a full bar? Yes. At the cost of focus? No. The simple beauty of the Hatch Burger has given way to odd customizing and the pastrami on the new burger was fatty junk. The spooned sauces were an odd touch and the hit and miss service by Randy made me look bad to a new guest. I have put Umami on the list of must stops for anyone visiting LA for years. No more. Trying to appeal to everyone has backfired for this franchise. The last touch...the bun was inedible and the onion rings a gross misfire.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2255,5th time here because Hoboken was packed. Near mentally challenged service. Slow service. Stupid order at counter service and mediocre pizza.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2256,Appetizers were good but this is a place for the budget eater. Large hunks of fish are not sushi. There is actually an art to the presentation of sushi and over use of mayo cannot hide poor quality fish. Staff was nice. Food was not.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2262,"A slow night and we decided to try it out after walking by dozens of time. The location is great. Bathrooms nice and the bar set up it cool. JUST DRINK. The food was mediocre at best. They forgot to bring half the items on a wedge salad. Forgot relish on the burger. Did not set the table. The staff was ok, but as the mistakes mounted, I realized they were treating everyone like a one time guest. A tourist. This always ticks me off since tourists talk and I spend a few months a year as a visitor or tourist elsewhere. The assumption that you will only see a customer once is the great mistake of hospitality businesses. Everyone should get top grade service. Especially with services like Yelp and Facebook. We will keep walking by now and I may enter for a Guinness. The one thing they got right the first time.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2265,Cafeteria pizza. Really. Waiting to be seated for school lunch quality pizza was no fun.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2266,Muy horrible.  All bad from margarita to tacos.  Service was weird as well.,ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2270,"For three years this restaurant was my oasis in the sea of chain food in Idaho Falls. I took clients, entertained there and took my personal meals. The food remains very good in comparison to the rest of town, but the loss of the spirits license and really lousy service have brought this place down to earth. An unimaginative wine list is accompanied by help like the spaced out waiter I had two times in a row. Ordering was like staring into dim headlights. No acknowledgement and the slowest of reactions. 2x my guests had to ask for the specials of the night. Multiple times requests for more mediocre wine were put off for up to 15 minutes. The capper was letting the owner know about the problem. His solution. Ask for a different waiter. I checked my expenses. The $1500 I was spending per annum will now be going to the Cellar across town.",ZpQprwVlYpRQDkq3khmvUg
2282,"Very disappointing experience! I've been signed with ATT for 7 years now, and I decided to go in, like I've done from time to time, looking for any promotional options where I might save some money. Upon entry, everyone was busy, which is great for business, so I waited patiently... considering there's no organized waiting area, I waited near the main register. As I stood there, I watched as a couple completed there transaction and left the store. Although noticing me standing at the register, I was completely ignored and in fact the next 2 customers that arrived were acknowledged and helped while I continued to stand at the register looking desperate for help.....It got to a point where there were multiple available employees, including a Manager who were standing in the front of the store... So I politely approached and asked if there were any ""available employees"" that could assist me, considering that I had been waiting for almost 10 minutes with zero recognition.I'll leave the employees names anonymous that pretended to help me, and after sitting with them for a few minutes and looking at what options were available, there was nothing that they could offer me to save money, they didn't even have any recommendation that I might leave with something to think about. This visit was sadly a huge waist of my time.",MGZ9PQ_U_N9K0qptHeXgmQ
2291,"Just to begin, I had been warned NOT to give this restaurant any business, however, it's local and upcoming, and I wanted to support them and share my own experience. The reviews are fairly mixed, so you never know, but now I understand the issues. I placed an order online via Yelp for the Saturday - Daily Special: Oxtail Dinner with Rice and Gravy. Shortly afterward, I called to see what the wait time would be since I was working and my lunch break begin in 30 minutes. I was planning on pick-up.... The gentleman that I spoke to informed me that the daily special would be at least a 1 hour wait,  Whoa! Okay that was discouragment from the beginning. I've mentioned before, since working in restaurants, I've become accustomed to particular standards. The daily special specifically, should have heavily made preparations ready in advance so disbursement can be done timely and efficiently. There certainly shouldn't be 60 minutes wait times at 2:30 pm. However, I remember they are new, and there's always room for improvement somewhere.I decided to wait for an hour before leaving work to go pick-up my food, and upon arrival the gentleman who I was standing at the counter asked me to wait so he could put my food together.  Whoa! Hmm again, I don't understand why my order still isn't ready. They did not seem busy, and I was the only customer in-shop. Now anxious, and hungry I'm having to wait an additional 5-7 minutes until I got my food, and forced to raced back to work      Once I got back to work and opened the container and I saw the food, and I admit I was disappointed. The oxtails almost resemble what I imagined canned meat to be  the gravy was bland, and obviously not homemade, the rice was extremely over cooked and there were hardly any side of my greens in the tray. Somehow my red beans and rice was switched into a green salad that sat on top of the warm food and absorbed condensation. The food was then almost cold, which confims that it was not made ""Fresh""... I felt cheated, and that it was such a waste. Unfortunately, my experience was not a positive one, kind of awful experience actually. I would recommend that you thoroughly examine your food once you finally get it. My original order was placed via Yelp because of incredible photos they have posted, but those photos are not mirroring the quality received. Very misleading! Although I wish this restaurant the best of luck  I will not be returning to Angel City Deli",MGZ9PQ_U_N9K0qptHeXgmQ
2298,"Granted, I always go to Walmart for my ammunition I expected the experience would be the same at every location, however, coming to this location was oddly disappointing... for starters it's strike me as a huge surprise that the weaponry department is included inside of the toy department, I would expect some type of separation from the two, like most other Walmarts that I've been into. But besides the poor location of the guns and armor, there was a shortage on the amount of ammunition they carried. That being said, I decided to purchase all the cases they had in stock (which were only three) after asking for all three cases I was told I could only be sold one case because of the department policy... again I say I always purchase my ammunition at Walmart in bulk because of the great prices they hold. So now I'm frustrated with these ""department policies"" that are new to my knowledge... Whatever, I'll take one case.The guy at the counter also didn't have the keys to open the cabinet because he allegedly doesn't work in that department, so he called over the intercom for the key holder... So I waited, and waited, oh and also waited some more.....After 17 minutes and 43 seconds of waiting, the keys magically arrived and I was finally granted access to my ammo. The guy at the counter did his best to call for the key holder at least 4x before they arrived and he apologized for the wait. He also sold me 2cases vs the initial one I was quoted.All in all, I'm not in this area enough to need to return to this Walmart ever again.",MGZ9PQ_U_N9K0qptHeXgmQ
2308,"This was my first time specifically at this location, and I will probably never return. I went in looking to receive a few dietary supplements and nutrition bars. As I walked in I noticed there were no customers in the store, but there were two employees standing at the register socializing and ignoring the fact that a customer being myself I had just walked in, and the door ding definitely acknowledged that I was in the store... But I ignore the lack of customer service and shopped around anyway, grabbed a couple of items that I was looking for, and as I was shopping I heard a couple of customers enter the store... Each time these customers entered the two staff members greeted them with a great attitude, which I couldn't help but over hearing considering how empty the store initially was. So after the third customer being greeted I walked over to see these customers and noticed that each of them were of Caucasian decent;1. Middle-aged white guy in a suit who immediately got assistance. 2. Elderly white woman who immediately was asked if she needed anything. 3. Younger white woman in a workout uniform. This GREATLY stood out to me, and I was very disappointed at the racial profiling that I experienced. It wouldn't be the first time I've experienced this, so I know what it is when it happens... Instead of confronting the employees I simply placed all my items back where they belonged and left the store with a great frustration. Normally I would at least get the employees names from a situation like this, but I was so disappointed that all I wanted to do was leave... And that's what I did. That's horrible that we still have to experience these things in 2017.I can only hope management gets this message to know what goes on in their store. Smh",MGZ9PQ_U_N9K0qptHeXgmQ

I don't understand how the prices here are more expensive than other dispensaries and the weed is mediocre.The whole purpose of having an online ordering system is to decrease the inconvenience of waiting in line, so I ordered 30 minutes prior to my arrival, arrived and gave my name and stood there for an additional five minutes as the employees ran around in circles not knowing where my order was... Who I was... Or what I had ordered... This is literally the worst dispensary to go to, and it really sucks because it's conveniently located to my home, but I rather drive all the way to Seattle than ever commute here again... honestly.",MGZ9PQ_U_N9K0qptHeXgmQ
2320,"I came to Les Schwab this morning a soon as they opened 0800. I was intending on getting a tire swap (done for free as long as ties are mounted), but 15 minutes after they started working on it, I was informed that the tire I was about to put on the car were only at thred 3 and so they tried to sell me new tires... I couldn't afford new tires at the time, so I asked that they put back on the wheels I was currently using... Well that was a waist, but then one of the technicians fucked up my lug caps, and I was asked to return for an additional appointment to replace the lug. They were claiming to need to order the lug (Why aren't you pre-ordering lugs if you specialize in tires) and asked that I return the following week. They attitude of the technicians was appropriate, but the fact that I waited my time, and a mistake was made by their staff really seems to bother me... I probably will not be returning to this location.I was able to get taken care of the same day at the Les Schwab just south from this location, on Central Ave.",MGZ9PQ_U_N9K0qptHeXgmQ

I don't know exactly how long is been since my last visit, but my friends and I were on a mission to get Ethiopian food. We had already had multiple encounters on the same day, where sanitation was an issue from the restaurants which let us to going to Saba, where we thought we would have a reliable good quality experience. From the moment we walked in and we were being stared at as if we were not welcome to the smell of the restaurant being very disturbing, we had questioned if we were going to stay, but again a few of us had been to Saba so we decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately the server was very irritable and unhelpful with taking our drink orders as well as our food orders and once we finally got our water after waiting for what felt like 20 minutes, and the water was full of dirty ice... Not just dirty, But disgustingly brown ice. At that point we all knew it was time to go, unfortunately I do not believe I will ever return to Saba again. I would advise everyone to at least give restaurants a shot, but if you walk in there and the smell is bad and you're being looked at disturbingly, then take note of the signs.",MGZ9PQ_U_N9K0qptHeXgmQ
2331,"Let me start by saying that I normally enjoy my experience shopping at The Container Store, and that I have been a return customer for a few years now. I have spent thousands of dollars on various items throughout the years with this company. My experience while shopping at the container store yesterday was one of the most discourteous, rude, and belittling experiences that I have EVER had while shopping at any establishment that I've spent thousands of dollars at!!! Thanks due to PATRICE! Yesterday at approximately 7 PM I went shopping at the container store in hopes of finding new shoe containers for my 67 pairs of shoes. I recently moved into a new home and I am looking to organize things differently, and of course what other better place than the container store. It almost worked out perfectly, as I entered the store I saw there was a sale for the shoe containers that came in a bundles of 20. If you buy two bundles you save 50% on the third bundle, which still costs you somewhere around $75-80 but the sale was president nonetheless. As I continued shopping around admiring the various containers throughout the store I was holding an item called ""Nifty Nabber Grabber"". I've seen this on television but I've never used one myself, but it is actually a very handy item and it's even fun to use. As I'm making my way through the isles I was approached by a woman named PATRICE, who immediately rudely asked me why I was playing with the ""Nifty Nabber Grabber"". I told her I planned to purchase the item, and she actually laughed at me saying ""Look I know you're not going to purchase that item, and if you keep playing with it, it's going to be a used item for the customer who actually will purchase it."" She told me ""people come in here playing with those all the time, so stop playing with it, and return it to it's place."" We exchanged very few words, mainly me telling her how much I did not appreciate her speaking to me that way, and her being very combative as if SHE had every right to talk to me the way she was.My frustration had literally rose to an all-time high! I had never felt so disrespected, she was speaking to me as if I was a child toying around making a ruckus throughout the store! Am I not a paying customer? Like I mentioned, I have been to the store many times and I have spent thousands of dollar$$$, but I have never seen PATRICE, however her attitude and disrespectful words, were enough for me to leave the store for good. PLEASE: Beware of the angry woman named PATRICE! She clearly prefers to 86 the loyal customers!",MGZ9PQ_U_N9K0qptHeXgmQ

For starter's, upon entry of the restaurant the waitress aimlessly stared at my friend and I who had both never gone to this restaurant, so I asked the waitress if we are to see ourselves and she aggressively stormed towards the seating area stating to follow her, strike 1. Once she set us in the far back at the smallest table and walked away my friend and I looked at each other and agreed to move to a larger more comfortable table shortly after she came storming to the table she initially set us at telling us that we had better moved back to our table, so I asked why we couldn't sit at our new table and the waitress stated she was the only worker and did not have time to walk to our table or clean multiple tables and that the table was too big for two people anyway, strike 2. After going back to our initial table and getting our drink orders I asked for hot water and the waitress rolled her eyes at me stating that they would charge me for hot water, & I smiled and said ok so again she stormed off, strike 4. By this time I told the waitress that I understood she had a long day but she needed to be mindful that we were customers and that its very unprofessional to be rude, she didn't take that so well.

2422,"I was so excited to try this place while exploring Ballard. The reviews were all great! But, it reminded me of San Francisco hipster attitude in so many ways - and not in a positive way. We waited outside since we were there a little before they opened. One of the employees came out to write the specials on the wall but no hello, or hey we'll be open in 10, just wrote the specials on the board and ignored us. Then at precisely 9am, nothing happened. They just all stood inside starring back at us outside so all of us who were waiting figured well, I guess we just walk in, no ones gonna greet us. So we walk in, get seated, then are told to pay at the counter, great, I can do that! So, I'm hoping that the food is outstanding - why else would they have 4 stars? Unfortunately, I didn't think the food was that great either. But, for almost $20 for my scrambled eggs, salmon and super hard toast, I sat there and ate it.",Hxp9KgF2TPOln6bSAf2aBA
2442,"I'm super picky when it comes to my nails and so wanted to like this place, being so close to Westfield! I made an appointment earlier in the week for my friend and I got get a mani/pedi and another friend to get a short massage. Our appointment time comes around (2:30pm) and we were told that they do not do massages at their Mission location on weekends and that my friend could walk to their other location on Sutter or we could all come back 30 minutes later to get all of our services done and the owner would have more employees who could help at that time. We were in a bit of a time crunch but appreciated the gesture to try and make things work and came back at 3pm. Then, we waited more. My friend was taken in for her massage at around 3:15. It's apparent that everyone is still helping other customers. We're told to sit and at about 3:20 the owner started to work on my gel mani. She finished it in about 15 minutes and as I look at it today, the paint and color are great but I didn't pay for a paint change, I paid for a full on manicure.After she sped through me, she finally went to soak my friends feet for his pedi. We had mentioned we had to be out by 3:45 to make it to a 4pm movie over at the Metreon and she sped through his pedi in literally 10 minutes. When have you ever had a 10 minute pedicure?!?! Of course at this point, he wasn't able to get them buffed or clear polish or anything...In the end, it cost us all about $150 for all 3 services with tip. I'm not sure about you but I typically get a mani/pedi to get away from the world and relax for an hour while being pampered. I definitely wasn't expecting our experience to feel like she squeezed us in as a favor and rushed.Oh right, and I was gently bitten by the most adorable golden doodle while there. It's lucky that I love dogs and have one of my own but could definitely see how some people could be turned off by a dog wandering around while trying to get a mani/pedi.",Hxp9KgF2TPOln6bSAf2aBA
2443,"I really wanted to like this place and finally made the pilgrimage knowing I'd have to stand out in the cold. Last night's wait (Saturday night) wasn't bad - only 30 minutes. After standing in the cold, we were let in to wait at their bar area. This idea is brilliant on their part because, there you're finally in, starting to order and you're gonna wait however long more it's gonna take to get a table. About 10 minutes later, we were taken inside to a large communal table in the center of the restaurant where we waited another 10 to finally order after asking someone to please take our order. The food came out pretty quickly and even while starving, the food was just ok. Definitely not worth the 50+ minute wait to get to this point. The last straw and why I'm deducting an extra star under A-ok, is the fact that they do not let you take any of your food home.Also, note to anyone who is wanting to try this place- they call ""last call"" on apps and deserts at 9pm on Saturdays. So don't come in late thinking you can get a pork bun because it's too hard to cook after 9pm apparently.",Hxp9KgF2TPOln6bSAf2aBA

Last time, things were awesome- customer service was great, food was great and we couldn't have left happier. Since moving nearby, I've been by twice more. The first time was around 8:30, when we stopped by for just one drink before heading home. It was pretty empty except for one other table of 6 and the kitchen had decided to close early. No problems here, as we didn't come for food. The service was slow and bartender seemed annoyed that we had stopped by. We almost left but my bf wanted one beer and figured we could sit there and try to enjoy it for 10 minutes. The second time was a much shorter experience. We walked over last Monday just to grab a nightcap around 8:45. Got there and everything was black, gate shut and definitely closed.

My mistake last time was ordering the Lox bagel with the least fresh lox I've ever seen in my life. This time around I thought hey- let's get a breakfast bagel, you can't go wrong with eggs cheese and bacon. But I was wrong.

When we finally got her in to try a dress, no one helped and when we asked if there were other sizes of the dresses out on the floor, we were told that there were none without her even looking.

Tons of potential, right next to the ballpark and outdoor seating next to the water. Unfortunately, service was horrible and filled with miscommunication. There were no seats available at the bar or in the back so the what seemed like the hostess said we could sit in the dining room. However, there wasn't a server assigned to the area so she could take our order or we could go up to the bar. No problem, I'm not above walking up to the bar to place an order. A few minutes passed and she came back to take our order. She was awesome. A minute later, another lady came by our table and basically said we couldn't sit there. There wasn't a server and she was prepping the area for dinner. Keep in mind, there's a group of four guys sitting next to us yelling and cheering on the Raiders on tv. She didn't tell them to leave.

Then no one wants to come and you get the- I'm so sorry, we couldn't find a match phone call about 15 minutes before you thought you'd be in massage bliss.

The beer was pretty good but the service was the worst I've had in a long time. No real recommendations and an hour before closing told us that we had to drink the entire pitcher quickly because she was closing soon. We ordered another beer when she called last call to which she made it and yelled at us from the bar that our beer was ready.

This isn't a nightclub- it's just a bar. The bartenders were hating on all the ladies in my group and would only pay attention to the guys. That's fine, they can order for me but seriously? Just not cool. One of them also didn't seem to know how to make many drinks and kept saying ""oh let me look that up. It has different portions."" Really? In SF I kind of expect you know what you're doing.As for food, I was a little underwhelmed as well. We ordered about $75 worth of food to share amongst our table and nothing was really that great that I would recommend.

I quickly learned about the hold that would be on my card forever - which thankfully with Chase, I got my money back today, 3 days later. I also learned about how I was supposed to return the bike every 30 minutes to get a new code (since I had purchased the 24hr pass). Needless so say, I was worried about exactly how long I had borrowed my bike and what random charge I would see on my account next. Luckily, I was charged a total of $26 for (2) 24hr passes at $9 each + $4 for an additional 30 minutes for each of us. Recap: $26 for 1 hour of riding for the 2 of us. I can't say I didn't have a blast on my 1 hour spontaneous bike ride but for the hassle of having to take the bike back every 30 minutes, I'd probably be better off renting from a bike store or just buying one to use in the city.",Hxp9KgF2TPOln6bSAf2aBA

Why was I impatiently waiting for my food if it was sitting somewhere waiting to come to me that whole time and getting cold?! My friend had asked for jalepeno's on the side of his burger but they were inside and way too many of them. And the last burger? It was the Red Tavern and has sauce and too many tomatoes that the entire burger was just too mushy to eat.

Even the sports bras... I found ONE in lingerie by Jockey. It was fine, except it only came in bright red. Not my color.On my way out, a Coach bag caught my eye. I walked around and decided I pretty much wanted it. A salesperson came by and tried to open the drawer that holds the keys. Why we have keys and codes to open drawers of key is beyond me. She whipped out a crumpled up piece of paper with the codes on it and could not get it open. Five minutes later she called someone and complained that they had written down the wrong code for her. Their bad. Then she finally got the bags out and contradicted all the information she had given me about them when they were locked up. She knew nothing about her merchandise and had just basically made up stuff. I asked for a new one from the back since it looked like they had a lot of them. She said it was going to take a while since she would have to run to the back. On top of that, 2 other customers were waiting for her. She pretty rudely told them that there was no one else that could help them and that she was helping me. So when she was done, then she would acknowledge them. I gave up and left. Now I remember why I just shop online or not at Macy's.",Hxp9KgF2TPOln6bSAf2aBA
2886,"Order took way to long to come out. It was take out. Veggie egg rolls were wrong, grease and cold. They let them sit and took to long for Pho.  Rethink this place cause the food is fair and it was take out!",ZSGwtoxE-BXCAzUoENiX1w
2887,"Ok, having been going since the opened, they have lost it.Service was bad.  She wasn't attentive, at all.  She was slow and couldn't keep things right. Then came the epic piece, I couldn't hear the female manager verbally chastising another employee out in the open.   Guys get it together.  Your drinks are already 'special' and over priced... FYI, changing names and using smaller craft liquor doesn't justify $$.  If you can't make the basic drinks (margarita, moscow mules, old fashioned, etc)... changing the name and using cheap flavored alcohol won't help. The food is still decent. Even thoughI ordered a pasta at happy hour and my friend did about 20 min after me.... the portion sizes were dramatically different. Once a great place falling to below to just painfully average.",ZSGwtoxE-BXCAzUoENiX1w
2896,"Asked for sliced brisket got chopped beefChicken was basicThey offer up hotlink. Best thing in the place. Don't waste your money this place is painfully average and depends on sauce for flavor.  Smoking is about meat, Wood, and rubs.... they missed 2 or the 3.",ZSGwtoxE-BXCAzUoENiX1w
2897,I wantedTraditional and this was the only place that was open. Who puts carrots in a poboy. They also ran out of tea.  And it wasn't sweet.  This is New Orleans not Seattle!,ZSGwtoxE-BXCAzUoENiX1w
2898,"PainfullyAmericanized beyond averageNothing special. Butter chicken fairCurry lacked luster, flavor and appeal.  What is really odd is that the place was crowded. If you want good food look for a place that have people native to the food. This place had almost none. I should have left when I asked the waitress how is the curry?  She said amazing when the owner cooks.I failed to ask of the owner was cooking that night. Lesson learned. Won't see me again.",ZSGwtoxE-BXCAzUoENiX1w

I walked into the facility for a quote.  I counted 5 people working in the office and 1 gentlemen asked if need help.  When i told him I needed a quote, he asked if I had an appointment. I responded no.   He stated he could make one for the next day.  I asked with 5 people working I need to come back?  Not a problem, I will never be back. If the business can't take 10 min to take pictures, and get basic information and let me know that they will email a quote, they don't need my business nor anybody I know it follows me.",ZSGwtoxE-BXCAzUoENiX1w
2900,Went there last night for the national championship with some friends.  The food is horrible!   I don't know what the new owners/managers are doing but they need the old cooks back.

2918,"I am almost tempted to give 1 star, but decided to be generous because of a couple of saves. I also really wanted to love this place because I LOVE Orfeo and really like Steelhead Diner, too. I went with 4 other people for SRW, though only 1 of us ordered off SRW fare, the rest of us ate from the main menu. The molasses seed bread with honey butter was plentiful and delicious! The Brussel sprouts were really yummy. We all ordered steaks, Rib-eye and the SRW person got a Hangar. None of the fat was rendered well on any of the steaks and every single one was overcooked. All were ordered as medium-rare, but 3 came out medium and the others medium well. That really sucks when you're paying nearly $50 for a steak. The sides were good, especially the veggies because they were properly cooked. The service is what really sucked for us, pretty much from start to finish. When we arrived (made reservations), at least 3 people walked by and said someone would be right with us. Took at least 5 minutes for the hostess to arrive, though we did get promptly seated in the restaurant which was about half-filled. Our primary waiter was quite scattered and inattentive. He would frequently miscount wine glasses, plates, menus. Half the time, he would be trying to crack clever jokes and the other half he was no where to be found. Another server stepped in a few times and he was really on top of things and looked after our few needs. The straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak, was that we weren't asked how we wanted to divide the check. Main server just dropped off the check. We waited and waited, but finally had to flag down our helpful alternate server and he said that each seat was tabbed separately....except it wasn't. Our main server jumbled everyone's orders/drinks in different places. Seat 1 had 3 of the 5 drinks, seat 5 had 2 steaks on it, etc. We finally just put it on one card and Venmo'd the primary payer. The restaurant add-on an automatic 20% service fee, which normally I am completely fine with. This sucked so bad that I would have left 15% for the server and then slid a little ""somethin' somethin'"" to the server who actually helped us.  Unfortunately, this will be on our ""do not return"" list. :(",Y5b286tescycns--SAZ-yg
2923,"I'm giving this a 2 mainly because of the large rooms and friendly staff. We came for a concert at Tulalip Casino. Hotel prices were seemingly super high this weekend ($289 at Tulalip Resort Hotel and $169 here). The rooms are fairly typical of HIE though they don't appear to have been updated in at least 10 years. There is a TV, mini kitchenette with Keurig, microwave, fridge, a desk, a sofa, and a table with 2 chairs. The bathroom was adequate. Main rubs were the noise, price, and shuttle service. NOISY...all day and all night. Walls, ceilings, doors are incredibly thin. It sounded like a business was operating above our room with all the stomping, pounding, and some other noise that sounded like a sliding door opening and closing every few minutes. If anyone is in the hallway, you will hear every word they say and every sound they make. Shuttle bus to the casino is about a 30 minute trip between each location. It takes about 5 minutes to drive. Price. I get that you can charge what the market bears, but for the very basic amenities and old decor, HIE should really bring more to the table. We opted to eat brunch at the casino, so didn't try the free breakfast. Our view was of a wall about 5 feet away from the window. I should have paid nearly double the price for the resort hotel.",Y5b286tescycns--SAZ-yg
2939,"Went in for a replacement computer charger and a wireless doorbell. There seemed to be many employees, but no one checked on us. Had to track people down. No computer charger fit. They still carry the exact model for sale in the same store where initial purchase was made. Again, nada, not even in the 3 multi-tip charger packs. No better luck for a doorbell either. After tracking someone down, all they were interested in selling was one with a security camera. Guess we have to resort to Amazon.",Y5b286tescycns--SAZ-yg
2940,"The security here is insane. I experienced something for the first time today. Not only take off shoes, jackets, empty pockets, remove laptops and other electronics, now apparently we remove any edible item from bags, purses, etc., and put them in a bin. Candy, protein bars, trail mix, gum, mints. Wth? Someone please tell me why. Of note, I'm from Seattle and when I flew out of there just a week ago, we did not take off shoes, empty ANYTHING out of our bags. We were also told, ""your bag is your bin."" So everything went in and stayed in your bags. There were no bins. Extraordinarily proficient with security in a very busy airport at Sea-Tac. If they can streamline, so can everyone else. What gives? Shouldn't all airports have standard security measures? They are all run by the TSA, right?Tulsa International Airport - why is it called that? Are there actually any direct international flights to/from here? Limited eating choices. Fairly modern, but could do with some improvements.",Y5b286tescycns--SAZ-yg
2949,"From start to finish:This establishment requires patrons to be 21 or older. Parking - across the street for almost $10 for 2-4 hours. There is street parking if you can find anything (we couldn't). A bus stop is within a block or two. The theatre is old and it shows. The food/drink ordering area is quite cramped. It wasn't that busy (I counted around 30 people in the area at the time), but it felt very crowded because of the cramped layout. Food - honestly, quite an anemic menu. About 10 items on the menu and nothing special. If you order food off the menu, you are given a pager and paged when your order is ready. Not convenient, at all. Again, it wasn't busy and I was told 15-20 minutes for my single item order. I got a Seattle hot dog and it was actually pretty good. The bread was a brioche type bun. Plump and juicy dog with the typical Seattle fixin's of cream cheese, grilled onions, and came with a tiny side of sauerkraut and potato chips. Also got some popcorn which was terribly stale and on the verge of burnt. The butter taste was old, bordering on rancid. Screen - The theatre is small and the screen is even smaller. I really wasn't expecting such a small screen. I'm not sure if all the screens are like this. Chairs - comfortable to sit in. They rock a little bit, but no recline, no heat, no footstool, or other features. Overall, it was like a bargain $1 theatre which wouldn't be bad, but these tickets were $12 (digital, not 3D which was more) for absolutely nothing special. I would never go here again. Definitely not worth the price or experience.",Y5b286tescycns--SAZ-yg
2954,"Yep, definitely have had better. The one thing this place has going for it is it's cheap. Like $2.50 for a small. Drove by here once, stopped a different time and didn't see a line. Only saw one other couple while I was there. The women that were there working were the least friendly people I have come across on this island. Never cracked a smile, short questions, short answers. Flavors are incredibly bland. I don't understand what people are talking about with the texture of the shave ice because if you don't eat it in the first 5 minutes, it gets crunchy and hard just like any shave ice will. FYI, here, snow cap doesn't mean the usual condensed milk. It's some super thinned out condensed or other sweet milk. Matsumoto Shave Ice has my heart. Far superior taste to me. Buy hey, if you don't want to wait in line for some really tasty shave ice, go to this place.",Y5b286tescycns--SAZ-yg
2956,"Ugh, this airport! Flew outbound a few days ago and almost everything about it was painful. Flew Hawaiian Airlines and it was easy enough to check in and get luggage tags with the self-service kiosks. If only the navigation to the gate were that easy.The signage is horrible, can't tell which line one should stand in: TSA pre-check vs. first class passengers vs. coach passengers. TSA staff was crotchety and we were moved to 3 different lines during our wait. Had to be patted down after screening. After we arrived to our destination, we found that one of our bags had been opened for inspection, which is fine, they have a job to do after all. There was a sticker that was placed around the handle of the bag which must have melted in the heat because I cannot for the life of me get the residue off my suitcase! Exhausting.  There is a bus for transfers between terminals, called the Wikiwiki (which incidentally means fast or speedy in Hawaiian. HA!!). Went upstairs and walked until we found it. We had to pass through the agriculture checkpoint and have all carry on items scanned again. Then told someone at the desk which gate we were headed to. If you can walk, just do it. Apparently the Wikiwiki only comes every 20 minutes. Guess we should have asked that to begin with before we waited 15. We could have strolled to our gate faster.  Upgrades are needed throughout this airport. It is also unbelievable that in 2017 there is no wifi available at the airport.",Y5b286tescycns--SAZ-yg
2958,"Made a dinner reservation, though probably didn't need one as it wasn't overly busy on a weeknight at 7pm. The ambiance was a bit lackluster. The outside area was small, but looked nice. Inside was extremely dated with strange decor that was worn and tattered. Even the menus were stained and torn. We received waters and a small piece of a bread loaf just after being seated. There is olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the table for self service. We went ahead and ordered some garlic bread which was really the same bread, sliced and toasted, with some melted butter on it. The garlic was roasted and the whole clove was split and served with the bread; the roasted garlic made the sad bread so much better. I mean you can't really go wrong with roasted garlic. We had a wine and an Italian beer. The wine list was adequate, though not extensive. The Caesar salad we split, plenty for both with some leftover. It was fine, very garlicky which I do like. For dinner, I chose the Gnocchi Gorgonzola and added Italian sausage to it. There was another preparation with sausage, so I figured I would just add it to the cheesy version to get some meat. I think this must have been a big mistake. Something was off and I did not enjoy the dish, at all. I prefer that someone (the chef, or wait staff) tell me that this would not be a good combination if that is the case. Honestly, even the gnocchi wasn't even that great. My wife had Lobster Ravioli and it was wonderful. The sauce was creamy and velvety. The ravioli was cooked to a lovely al dente. This particular dish could have easily been given 5 stars. We dipped our remaining bread in the bowl to sop up all that wonderful sauce.We perused the dessert menu and there were several to choose from: Tiramisu, Mascarpone Cheesecake, Creme Brulee, Gelato to name a few. We decided to skip it this visit. Parking was on the street and we had no difficulties finding a spot but there are a couple of parking garages nearby if things were busier. Definitely would not drive from outside of Kailua for dinner here.",Y5b286tescycns--SAZ-yg
2966,"I was so excited to celebrate my birthday dinner here. We had reservations, said it was my birthday. On arrival, we were nicely greeted, they asked who's birthday it was. Then we were seated at a nice window table. The atmosphere is nice and the view is pretty nice too, but you do have to look through another glass railing lined with dozens of handprints and bird poop. It took about 10 minutes before the server came to greet us. We ordered a bread basket ($4) while we finished looking over the menu. The restaurant was not busy at this time, at all. Maybe 5-7 other tables at our 7pm seating time. She returned in about another 10 minutes. We went ahead and ordered our food at the same time as our drinks not knowing how long it would take her to return. About 15 minutes went by with no visit from the server and then we finally flagged her down to see about our drinks. She said they would be right out. Then, 2 minutes later our entrees came out.  Before our drinks. I don't think that has ever happened to me before.  We asked the food runner about our drinks and he said they were slow in the bar and that it happened a lot there because the kitchen was faster than the bar. Seriously? The food was actually almost 4 stars, but the service was absolute crap, especially considering we told them it was a special occassion. Will not return, and honestly wouldn't recommend.",Y5b286tescycns--SAZ-yg
2967,"Terrible! Lack of items on the menu, booth seats are wobbly, food is awful. Their chopped salad is more of a meat/veggie salad there's meats, cheese, so on and very little lettuce, that's not a salad. Their meatloaf extremely salty, their Mac n cheese greasy.Disappointing, am surprised this place is still open, they need a lot more items to choose from on their menu and food needs to taste better. After coming to this spot 3 times now, we won't be back anytime soon.....",havBggvuzfE6IPfkT-njbg
2968,"We've had take out a few times and it was good. We've eaten there twice in person and both was ok. The first time the grilled flank steak was over done and we asked for medium, where you still had some pink, there was no pink. This time one of us had Thea wonton dish that just has shrimp wontons and sprouts, which was ok and the other had yellow curry, disappointing as did not want it spicy the lady said 2 is not spicy, well it was, not enough pork in it, very little carrots and potatoes and the onions were barely cooked, they tasted as if they were raw, not a good night at Buddha Ruska. May give this spot another chance but will see",havBggvuzfE6IPfkT-njbg

Will we go back here, not sure. Sad though, we had high hopes for this place",havBggvuzfE6IPfkT-njbg

Well the tots were overly seasoned, it tasted like someone poured salt all over, the tots were nasty, then there was the pizza, they might as well not even bothered to put any pesto sauce on as there was hardly any and the crust was beyond burnt, that was awful.The Hub WAKE UP!!!

Maybe it was we ordered it at 6pm knowing they closed at 630pm but they had orders b4 us and after us. But this pizza which we had tonight, it has chicken, feta, tomatoes, mozzarella, spinach, mushrooms and onions, and pesto as the sauce, was AWFUL. The tomatoes which are usually throughly cooked all the way, was not, the cheese some parts were melted as it should be but other parts of the pizza were not and most of the pizza crust was burned to a crisp.So would we go back again, I would least one more time but I'm so disappointed in this joint now.",havBggvuzfE6IPfkT-njbg

I was surprised I said no you don't and I said when you order those samples are FREE and yours to keep and I even called customer service and they said same thing I did. So the gal said well I will do your return without the samples this time.Today July 17th, went into this Ulta again with my mom who's visiting my husband and I. She wanted to check out and buy OPI nail polish, as they are currently on sale 2 for $16 bucks, so I pick one and so does my mom, well the lady at the counter, rang them up and said total was 27 bucks and my mom and I look at each other and said ummm no, they are on sale 2 for 16$ all top coats, base coats and ALL lacquers,  the lady did not seem to believe us and went on her own to see for her self and she goes well I guess all lacquers so I will charge you what the sale price is.Dear ULTA teach your people BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE and stop trying to make your customers feel stupid! We are NOT stupid and do not like we r getting ripped off by you!",havBggvuzfE6IPfkT-njbg

The bulgogi had an odd consistency, almost like it was shredded. It was too lean/dry. The japchae was ok, but not good enough to save the meal. Dinner for 4 ran about $20.

My bun with egg roll and BBQ pork was generously portioned with fresh ingredients, but they skimped on the pork, which was dry and difficult to get off of the two small skewers it was served on. I had some of my family's pho, which was decidedly inferior to the majority of other pho places I've been to in the area. The broth was off, and the noodles were too firm and clumped together in that plasticky way that sub-prime rice noodles tend to get. I probably would not eat here again.",BFBn44X2gnL1f8qSRT0H-Q

3060,"Late review, but my gf and I came in for our one year anniversary. The lot for Chandler's is pay parking only, which seems silly for such an expensive restaurant. The view of Lake Union that we should have had from our table was completely wasted because the interior of the restaurant was so brightly lit, making it difficult to see out of the window. We started off with truffle fries. They came as thick potato wedges that were greatly undercooked. I was only able to eat a couple before I gave up. Our mains were ok; I had the crab-stuffed prawns, and she had the vegetable risotto. Unremarkable. I get that this is a rich person restaurant catering to yacht people, but I felt like we weren't getting the same caliber service as the tables around us who were running up higher tabs, who were getting faster and more attentive service. There was a couple near us that had the manager come out and wish them a happy anniversary, and offer them each their pick from a selection of desserts. When I had made our reservation, I had been asked if we were celebrating anything, and I mentioned that it was going to be our anniversary. When our check came I mentioned this to the waiter, who said ""oh"" and then offered us a creme brûlée to share. It was nice that they did that for us, but still irritating to think that our $100+ tab didn't warrant us the same service that some of the other tables were getting.",BFBn44X2gnL1f8qSRT0H-Q

I only ended up eating five plates, not because the portions were large or a particularly good value (they weren't), but because I was starting to feel queasy.

The staff throughout the food court are generally unapproachable at best, often just openly mean. The yakisoba/teriyaki place and the chinese food have especially poor food. The food court is always jam packed with people, and tables are hard to come by. Eat elsewhere, there is better food immediately surrounding the mall.",BFBn44X2gnL1f8qSRT0H-Q

3137,"My criteria for deciding between a two and three star review is whether or not I would firmly object if someone were to suggest eating there again. Lotus' downfall comes not from any glaring faults of its own, but more so from its failure to distinguish itself in any way in a city full of excellent Asian food. The menu comes in two sections: Chinese and Vietnamese. Several of my cousins and I went in and ordered several dishes, including spring rolls, crab wontons, vermicelli, orange chicken, fried rice, and sautéed cod. The food was uniformly underwhelming. The orange chicken would have fit in well in a grocery store deli. The cod, while tender, was in a completely flavorless sauce. The vermicelli was bland, and the veggies less fresh than you would find elsewhere. And so it went for every dish we ordered. What a bummer, since it's only a couple of blocks away from my new job.",BFBn44X2gnL1f8qSRT0H-Q
3141,"Three of us stopped in for a quick dinner, and we unanimously agreed that it was a two-star experience. The shrimp in the tempura udon was extremely overcooked to the point that the texture was so tough that it bore no resemblance to shrimp. Every piece of tempura was hard and coated too thickly. The broth was mostly flavorless. The chicken yakisoba was a little better, but the spices were a bit off. The chicken teriyaki was standard, if we had just ordered that it would probably have been three stars.",BFBn44X2gnL1f8qSRT0H-Q
3164,"Another airport, another forgettable fast food experience. They're shooting for a panda-esque feel but falling just short. I got the sweet and sour chicken, which was 75% breading and the remainer a rubbery, almost chalky piece of chicken. The sweet and sour sauce was thin, homogenous, and artificial-tasting. The nearby McDonald's would have been a much better choice.",BFBn44X2gnL1f8qSRT0H-Q

3236,"This place is the red-headed stepchild of Taco Time. Similar menu, but falls flat on its face. I had the soft taco, which was mostly dry tortilla and lettuce. The salsas tasted like they came straight out of a tin can. Their hot sauce tastes how imagine Taco Time hot sauce would if I lost my sense of taste in a car accident. It didn't sit well in my stomach either. On the plus side it's cheap, but not as cheap as Taco Bell, which is nearby and better.",BFBn44X2gnL1f8qSRT0H-Q
3250,"Oh brother. I'll keep it quick. China first is consistently meh. The general Tso's chicken is ok, but they are buried so deep in the hierarchy of food on the Ave that there is no good reason to eat here rather than somewhere else.

We started with a bowl of bacon mac and cheese, plenty of bacon but too salty. For dinner I ordered the grilled cheese with bacon and apple, with tots as my side. The bacon was burnt to a crisp, and the bread didn't have the soft-yet-crunchy texture I was looking for. The bacon's flavor was well obliterated, so all that remained was an overwhelming apple taste. My classmates had similar things to say about their meals. Prices were a fair bit higher than what I'm used to in Seattle. On a plus note, the tots were good.",BFBn44X2gnL1f8qSRT0H-Q
3290,"My first 1-star review! This is exciting. The only drawback is that I had to eat here to reach this milestone. My family was having some car trouble so we decided to grab food at one of the closest places to my apartment. I walked in and took a look at the buffet. Big mistake! The food looked like it had been sitting there since the Ming dynasty (please hold your applause). The sado-masochist in me decided to order us some takeout. We got the General Tso's chicken, house special Mongolian and house special Lo-mein. I'll start with the good: the General Tso's chicken was palatable, about on par with what you get at Albertsons. It was all downhill from there. ""House special"" means four types of meat: chicken, pork, beef, and shrimp, but these meats were unrecognizable to me. If aliens had to go to their home planet and try to create meat in a lab based off of what they had read about meat in children's books, this is what they would have come up with. I had a really hard time even eating a few bites. We ended up throwing the lion's share of both these dishes away, and I HATE wasting food. I paid $35 for these three dishes, which is absolutely ludicrous. /endrant",BFBn44X2gnL1f8qSRT0H-Q

I found the noodles to be dry and bland, and the portion was sort of skimpy once I realized how much of the container was taken up by the carrots and cabbage. The chicken skewer was decent, but I thought $10 was a steep price to pay for what I got. Idk if this was there usual price or if they had raised it for the street fair, but I was very frustrated when I walked down a couple of blocks and found that Thaiger room (which makes a good phad Thai) was selling phad thai and a chicken skewer for $6.50.",BFBn44X2gnL1f8qSRT0H-Q
3356,"Went for dinner. The crab cake appetizers were very good, and the salad that came to my meal was fairly tasty. For dessert I shared a giant cinnamon roll with my roommate, it was covered in frosting and caramel and tasted pretty decent. My main course was terrible though. I had the corks, cheese and crab, which was corkscrew pasta in a Cougar Gold cheese sauce with Dungeness crab. I was really pumped up to try this as I love all things Cougar Gold and of course who doesn't like crab? The food was extremely salty, completely unsalvageable. The sauce was grainy and bland (how can you make Cougar Gold taste bland?). The whole dish was covered in low-quality faux parmesan cheese and funky-tasting croutons, with some pieces of undercooked broccoli thrown on top. It was a shame, I couldn't even taste the crab because the dish was so salty.    Might have gotten 3 stars if my meal had cost $15 instead of $40",BFBn44X2gnL1f8qSRT0H-Q

3381,Came in for some quick food. There was one thing that completely ruined the meal for us. Mayo dressing for the salad. Everywhere. In Globs. It was strange. The beef teriyaki was ok.

3425,"I'm updating my review for this restaurant because the first time we ordered from here, the experience couldn't have gone better. This time I'm entirely disappointed and almost shocked because it seemed like ordering from a totally different restaurant. Not only was the food terrible, but the wait time was long, the delivery bag was visibly leaking, and the boxes were smashed. The fried rice was not fried - it was streamed rice with minimal vegetables. I asked for medium spice and there was no spice at all. My boyfriend got the crispy garlic chicken / medium spice and there was also no spice. The vegetable spring rolls were soggy wet and drenched in whatever sauce leaked all over the bag. And to think I tipped the restaurant 20% via Eat24 before the food even arrived...never again. I hate to leave bad reviews, but really, wtf happened?",fJPA8p5TXvbaVNYSbOgtng
3431,"This place was packed, which was odd considering the quality of food my family and I experienced was sh*t on a plate. First of all, there were 6 of us and not one of us had a good meal. The menu boasted tons of options, which had me excited but the food turned out to be below average Tex-Mex. The drinks, margaritas specifically, were watered down and flavorless - yuck. I only give this place two stars because the waiter was friendly and you could tell he was overwhelmed with the amount of people in the restaurant.",fJPA8p5TXvbaVNYSbOgtng
3444,Disappointing...probably because I was sober. The mac n cheese was cold and tasted like mush and the toppings tasted like they were left out too long. We ordered 2 larges and threw them away after a few bites.,fJPA8p5TXvbaVNYSbOgtng
3447,"This a rustic little bbq shop in a cute ""country village"" surrounded by shops and lots of free roaming chickens. The staff is very friendly and the orders are delivered out quick. The dining room is small and full of random dining furniture. The food is served on trays or plates for sharing. We got a 4 meat plate and added a half slab of ribs. The pulled pork was very good. It was moist with a few good pieces of crisp. The ribs were good but not great. The brisket was not quite juicy enough and the slices were much thinner than what I'm used to. The tri-tip steak was decent as well. I've never tried it at a bbq place before and I was pleasantly surprised. The cornbread was a little undercooked but not inedible. The slaw seemed like it came from a bag and not fresh and the collard greens were not good at all. They had no flavor. I probably won't be back despite the impeccably friendly service.",pjQopHxykzK_J9io9BBBMg
3454,"Small burger joint by Green Lake with ok food and not great service. This fast casual joint seems retro and Hawaiian at the same time. The interior was fine and felt true to what they were trying to achieve. The guy taking our order seemed to really struggle with it and mid-order he stopped us and said he had to deliver food. It felt very odd for him to do that and we were worried that our order would be messed up because of this. They make all of the food fresh to order so you probably do have a longer wait time than expected. I got my burger in a lettuce wrap, which was a nice option, but before I got halfway through, it fell apart. I also ordered mine with the special sauce which just tasted like Chik fil a sauce to me. The coleslaw was less than impressive. My husband's order did come out wrong and we had to return it. Wouldn't bother to eat here again.",pjQopHxykzK_J9io9BBBMg
3473,"If I could give no stars I absolutely would. This was easily the worst dining experience of my life. Not greeted at the door despite the dining room not being very busy. We were shown to a table in the front of the restaurant and our waiter came to take our drink order. He was very inattentive and refused to explain menu items clearly. He rushed in and out quickly, did not make eye contact, and seemed to be generally annoyed by our presence. Once we ordered, much to the displeasure of our waiter, our food came to the table. This is when all hell broke loose. Flies swarmed our table and our food immediately. I'm not talking 2-3 flies. I'm talking 15-20 flies. At first we tried to wave them away with menus and our hands but they wouldn't give up. We had to track down our waiter who was obviously never coming back to check on us even though he could see our frantic swatting. We requested to move tables and he said he would inquire. He took his sweet time doing that while we fanned our food and desperately tried to take a few bites in between. The manager came over a few too long minutes later and informed us that because the front and back doors were open then there were bound to be flies everywhere. His condescending tone was not appreciated. We also pointed to the table beside us and it's pre-laid out silverware covered in flies. He said he would replace it which he did. Flies immediately came back and landed. At this point we figured that's what our silverware must have looked like before we sat down as well. We took a look back at our food now covered in flies and responded by saying we would take our business elsewhere. The manager seemed fine with this and our server came back over to see if we would like our check altogether or split in two. I think my jaw may actually have hit the floor but I made sure to close my mouth quickly in fear of eating any more fly feces that evening. We argued that we shouldn't have to pay for any food that we didn't eat. He ended up charging us a portion of the meal still.  I looked on as he lost customers over this since he continued to argue with my husband about it at the door and they looked in and then left. We personally reached out to the owner of this business through their website and received no response. Wow. I really still am not over how bad this entire experience was from start to finish. DON'T GO HERE. Just don't.",pjQopHxykzK_J9io9BBBMg
3477,"Laid back BBQ joint with a bar and mimosa Sundays. Stopped in on a lazy Saturday to get some bbq. Employees were courteous. Ordered brisket and pulled pork with collard greens and coleslaw and a couple of drinks. Food came out immediately and we went to the bar for drinks. Brisket is thickly sliced so you're getting a good amount of meat for your money here. Pulled pork was also thick pulls. It wasn't tiny shreds. The brisket was too over cooked for my taste but that seems to be a running theme here in Seattle. The pulled pork was good but not amazing. The coleslaw was too sweet and the collard greens needed some extra flavor. They were very plain. Bartender was very nice, but if you aren't drinking then you may want to grab take out. The interior isn't conducive to staying and hanging out.",pjQopHxykzK_J9io9BBBMg
3492,"After all the hype about this place I was sadly disappointed. The exterior is a little odd minus the cool sign. This place really does look like a barn. LoL! The inside seemed a bit clinical I think. It wasn't very inviting and it kind of felt like one big waiting room to be honest. We arrived at noon and were sad to discover that they stop selling breakfast at 11. I don't think it's very fair to have diner in your name and stop selling eggs at 11. Settled for the vegetable plate in an effort to drown my breakfast sorrows in vitamins. I chose Cole Slaw, Squash & Onions, Green Beans, & Carrots. The slaw was awesome! Best slaw I've had in Dallas. The squash and green beans were pretty good but nothing to write home about. The carrots were terrible. They tasted like they had been boiled way to long and then sprinkled with seasoning. I ate two bites and was done. The service was ok. It took awhile to get our check but that was it. All I can say is if you expect breakfast from a diner, find another diner.",pjQopHxykzK_J9io9BBBMg
3493,"This place is a big no thanks. The wait staff doesn't know how to handle even a mild rush. It took quite a while for us to be seated, place an order or get a refill. I ordered an egg white scramble with fruit. The serving of eggs was small and tasteless. I don't think they used salt or pepper even. The fruit was mostly frozen fruit and just mush. The melon wasn't ripe and the banana was completely green. Eggs and fruit should be the easiest meal but somehow they couldn't even do this right. I didn't even finish my plate and ended up getting a snack somewhere else after we left. What a waste of time and money.",pjQopHxykzK_J9io9BBBMg
3507,"Syrup is a popular downtown spot for breakfast and brunch. We arrived before 10am and still had to wait 45 minutes for a table. We grabbed lattes at the coffee bar and joined the other diners waiting just outside in the stadium seating to watch tv and wait to be called. The lattes were delicious and we were happy to have ordered them. When our name was called, we were quickly seated. Our waitress wasn't very nice and she didn't act like she really had time for us. We had a few questions about the menu that she wasn't able to answer and couldn't make suggestions either. We ordered the blackberry kir and it was delicious and a nice change of pace to mimosas. I ordered the gluten free pancakes with bacon, sausage, and walnuts cooked in the middle. They were very dry and would never have stood without syrup. Maybe that's how they got the name for the restaurant! I don't know. Besides the drinks, it was a bit of a disappointment. I wouldn't go back.",pjQopHxykzK_J9io9BBBMg
3513,Wow! So disappointed in my visit here. I had only heard good things but I guess I got the real story during my visit. We went about 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. We took a seat at the bar and waited at least 5 minutes to be greeted and given menus. The bar area was sticky and instead of cleaning it thoroughly the bartender wiped it with a wet napkin and that was it. We each ordered a cocktail off the drink menu and we discovered our bartender was very new when she had to search out another waitress to find the cocktail book so she could look up how to make them. We ordered right off their own menu. With no special requests. It was at least 15 minutes before we had our drinks. I ordered the grits and bacon. I assumed the grits would be very cheesy because TX Cheddar was the only description for them. They came out only sprinkled with cheese and so were very bland. I only ate about 4 bites before I gave up. The bacon on the other hand was delicious. But it's bacon so how can you go wrong there? We waited much too long for the check and when we finally left I was unsatisfied and still hungry. It may have been an off day here but I still feel like it was way too overpriced for what it was and I will not be returning.,pjQopHxykzK_J9io9BBBMg
3518,This place looked cute from the outside. The inside was pretty small and decorated with Picasso prints which seemed odd but we went with it. The Happy Hour specials seemed good so my husband ordered one of the specialty drinks and I ordered wine and edamame. It was more than 10 minutes before we saw our waiter again. When we did come back with our drinks he complained that he had to make my husband's drink because the bartender wasn't available. There were only two other tables with people in the whole place so I'm not sure what the bartender was busy with. Our food took quite a long time to come out and it was pretty generic. Similar to any other Thai place in a strip mall. The edamame was fine. It's hard to mess that up. The portions were very large. The wine tastes like two buck chuck and my husband's mixed drink was terrible. I would definitely not return even with the Happy Hour specials.,pjQopHxykzK_J9io9BBBMg
3519,"This a is Memphis style bbq place so skip the brisket and go straight for the ribs!When they say Shak, they mean it. This place is very small and looks very old as well.

I don't think they have air conditioning because it was pretty hot in there. Growing up just outside of Memphis, I should know Memphis bbq. The ribs were pretty good. I would definitely have them again sometime if I'm feeling nostalgic. The chicken was so dry I didn't eat most of it.  The green beans were pretty good but seemed like they might have been sitting for a while. Coleslaw was solid.

The have a gluten free menu and yet have only 1 cider on the entire beer list. Gluten free items don't include fries so you can't even have a burger with fries. I've tried two burgers and one salad. Burgers are fine. The bacon is the best part. The salad was basically dressing and cheese. I didn't eat most of it. All three times the visits have included some of the worst service I've ever had in Dallas. They are uninformed about the food menus and drink menu. They are slow to respond and sloppy.

Our waiter greeted us after a few minutes but seemed very unconcerned with our questions and offered different information to different people.We ordered and our food was brought out promptly. However then the real horror struck. Against the wall behind our table were several different paintings and on the paintings were hoards of gnats. They started flying around us and our food and we spent the rest of brunch swatting the air. We couldn't even enjoy the food for the intense need to get out of there fast. What I remember of the food: Omelette was weird and seemed to be pre-made by some type of device and not by hand. The bacon I ordered on the side was the best part. Also, I'm not sure they do anything for celebrations but I denoted on the reservation that it was a birthday but they didn't even offer up a simple Happy Birthday at any point.",pjQopHxykzK_J9io9BBBMg

It had absolutely NO flavor and all of the toppings came on the side so I had to put them on myself. I'm not really sure why they do this.To top it all off, after I finished my beef taco and decided never to eat there again, a roach crawled out from under my table and I nearly lost my dinner right there.I would rather not eat for a week than be subjected to eat at this ""taco joint"" again.",pjQopHxykzK_J9io9BBBMg

3611,"Sad pizza with light ingredients, I probably haven't been to a CPK in many years and that is the way it will stay. They just aren't what they were the pizza is so mediocre, no real flavor and expensive.

3612,First of all I have always considered Becks Prime a staple and a place I can get a consistent and decent meal since about 1999. I work right near the Kirby location and also frequent the Memorial Park location. I like it even though over the years it has gotten quite expensive. Just 20 minutes ago so that would be just before 2 pm I ordered a cheese burger medium rare with no bun. When they gave it to me the cheese was cold and not melted at all so I asked that they melt the cheese just a little. They obliged but when I cut in it was raw in the center and cold I ate some of the edges first so did not immediately notice but it was cold mush and gross.I went in and gave it back so they could see they have a person on the grill who cannot cook...they did not seem to give a crap.With so many choices for burgers in Houston bye bye Becks.,zxn9ZlFJKTTddjF6Du7rRA
3616,"Nice atmosphere and location but my breakfast was not so good, the cheese omelette was overcooked but had only the tiniest amount of cheese and since the omlette wasn't warm the cheese was firm not melted and soft. There was a piece of bread not toasted with it and that would be okay if it was fresh crusty bread but it was random and dry. My husband ordered the pomme frites and they were very good, my home fried potatoes were good but just barely warm.",zxn9ZlFJKTTddjF6Du7rRA

3636,"Wouldn't go back and stay here, it was not a good experience and there  are so many other hotels in the area.There was hotel construction going on while we were there, I understand why hotels don't tell guests this but at least locate guests to avoid extreme disturbances. Waking up on our first morning there was terrible noises at just after 8 am I was trying to sleep in  but was unable to due to the noise. Once I was awake and up I called the front desk about the terrible noise in our ceiling. Blah - blah -blah is what I got, we are trying to stop the work, they were not supposed to star until noon, blah -blah. i asked to be moved to a room higher up and farther away, they agreed but asked us to pack up our things and they would move us later in the afternoon. fast forward when we came back, they had deactivated our keys, the room was in my name but my husband, with the same last name had checked in with me and was given his own key....they refused to let him in the room or move him. I was out shopping and when I came back they told me I should not move rooms as the construction would be moving around the building and the drilling could happen anywhere, also they would not start until after noon. I stated that made no sense construction has a plan and a progression they don't move all over randomly and the project manager would know there locations for the particular day.So we did not move, they did not start until noon but in the afternoon we were unable to rest, cool off or hang out in our room and while we are out alot, it was hot and we are on vacation spending well over $300 a night!A manager did call us and ultimately we got one of our nights refunded which was a good gesture but they should have moved us.",zxn9ZlFJKTTddjF6Du7rRA

It is thin crust which I understand will be crispy but the cheese is also  dry and chewy rather than soft and melty (is that a word?). The red sauce is very intense almost like a highly seasoned tomato paste.

3649,"This hotel is a great location in Seattle, you can walk to so much or jump in a cab always waiting out front. The first room they put us in was next to the ""water wall"", about 5 am we were awoken by a terrible noise that sounded like some type of motor running. I walked around the room trying to pinpoint it but could not. I called the front desk and he acted as if he had no idea what it could be, I requested a room change which they agreed to. The concierge came to move us and he knew exactly the problem and moved us to a lovely and quiet room.This is getting a  bit long so let me tell you why it's a 2-star review and why we will not stay here again. In the order of importance,1. they put us in a crappy, noisy room for the 1st night and we didn't book thru any discount   site2. When we departed they charged us $60. to cover the 2 regular size bottle waters and a wine tasting that we never went to, i looked at it one day but it was crowded and lousy wine. They will say that this is an amenities charge and it is very upfront. That is not true and on Orbitz they state these are included. They very subtly say there is an amenities charge on their website. Sneaky and argumentative I do not abide by!!3. The elevator service is awful, so slow and then an elevator would arrive (we were on the 16th floor) and it would be full. this was Thursday thru our departure Sunday and of course was worse on Saturday when they have functions on the 5th floor. 2 elevators were working, 1 is for staff only and one must have been out of service but no sign to tell you that.There are simply too many hotels in Seattle to choose from to ever stay here again.",zxn9ZlFJKTTddjF6Du7rRA

He told me not to call them and he would get it for me. So 30 minutes later he calls and texts that it sold!! I was bummed as it was the 2nd car I missed. Then he starts texting pics of the white one.

I did not want a party with crew members I wanted for my friends to be together and the 5 crew just hung out,we had to talk with and over them, they were volunteers and were not needed.. also the boat kitchen was HORRIBLE, a mess impossible to use for food, smelled like oil, dirty was not ""under renovation"" it had been a disaster for ages. The captain was rude after I asked to get some of the"" crew"" off the boat, so it was bad, and we opted to end the ""tour"" early so we could eat our lovely picnic at home.

We had a dead bromeliad separating our deuce from another table and when I say dead at least 3 months dead.I want to like it but, the planter outside was dirty with trash in it and the parking lot is a mess and the entire strip center is dirty. i could get over all of that if the food was homemade and delicioso but it is not...sorry I was so hopeful!",zxn9ZlFJKTTddjF6Du7rRA

Host could not give us a table although there were many open, he told us our best bet was to grab 2 seats at the bar.

I said no we wouldn't do that, my husband and I looked at each other wondering if we dared stay and eat.

3824,"I stopped by here a few weeks ago on a drive back from an unexpected trip to NorCal. I was planning on powering through the whole drive after a sad weekend burying a friend who passed too young. Of course my drive takes me into Portland at the most ideal time.. 4:45 traffic hour. Most. Excellent.I decided to make my wait a bit more pleasant by finding a place to unwind with some snackas and a glass of wine. I was only able to do a quick search on yelp as I was driving and settled on this place with the killer cool name and promise of wine.The inside is super cute. One open concept dining area with tables and even a patio option. Industrial fixtures, a high ceiling, and some great art added to the effect. There was a bar with seating and a tv with sports on and a register where you do the ordering. Luckily it was not as busy in here as it was out on I-5 and I was able to nab a comfy corner.I checked out the menu and saw some delicious looking salad and sandwich options. No allergens were denoted so I checked with the server handling the register. I was super disappointed to get a nonchalant shoulder shrug and an -I don't know. so what do you want to order- response. I apologized for being a pain, but explained I am Celiac and it is an allergy and basically I just have a no choice lifetime membership to the ihategluten club. I made sure and asserted I wasn't picky and would eat anything on the menu naturally gf.I still got the - you're so annoying- attitude and the guys hanging at the bar made some smarty comments about gf and she laughed with them. Awkward. I tots get that not everyone caters to gf, but I mean.. we were in Portland yah? Gf mecca? That's what I thought. Nothing more awesome than being embarrassed for something you're genetically born with. I recovered and picked what seemed safest on the menu, the caprese salad. She rang it up and was ready to be rid of me but I had to make sure the balsamic reduction was gf or ask them to leave it off. She went to the kitchen, grabbed the bulk bottle and brought it to me for me to read which was appreciated.Food came out quickly and it was presented beautifully. I mean seriously is there a salad that could compete with the esthetics of a caprese? I think not. Mozzarella was good, portions were good, bits of torn basil and generous dressing of balsamic. The tomatoes were unfortunately rather flavorless but overall it was a decent salad.My original plan to outsmart the traffic with a leisurely dinner did not pan out as I was back on the road in 20 mins, but at least I wasn't starving. Prices were affordable and food was fine, but restaurant employees should absolutely be in the know about allergens and food ingredients. Even if they don't offer dedicated allergen free options.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw
3902,"Outdated? Sure, we love ourselves a good haunted mansion, but poorly maintained we were not prepared for. We stayed here on our honeymoon because we read some mixed reviews and were hoping that we would fall into the group that found it to be charming and quaint... unfortunately I think actually sleeping with the glow worms in their caves may have been more comfortable. We booked online and were out of cell range hiking most of the day. We arrived to the hotel late and found a curious check in situation. They apparently close their front desk, which was not noted online, and we saw an email from them that they were leaving our key at the back door. It was very dark and no lighting and we could not locate the key in the area they'd designated. We were lucky the hotel's board members were having a late meeting as our rummaging around got noticed and someone opened the door to let us in. We'd been out there about 15 minutes in the winter cold but who knows how long we'd have been there if they hadn't heard us.We were given a key and pointed towards our room. The rooms are not as depicted online. Not only is the hotel itself an older building, but it does not appear to be well kept. The room had a small bed they were advertising as a queen, but was certainly smaller than my husband's and my queen bed at home. It had minimal bedding that did appear clean, but certainly not as nice as the photos. The outdated decor was only beat by the archaic bathroom with damaged mirrors, fixtures, stained tub and floors, and threadbare towels.. I kept my footsies in my sandals to shower. The worst was that the room did not offer respite to the cold night outside. There is no central heating and the small portable furnace was unplugged and had not been turned on to prepare the room for us. We huddled together in pants/socks/ and beanies like we were camping and it was a challenge to fall asleep until the room finally warmed up a bit.Overall the building itself has a lot of potential, is a great historical asset to the local community, and the location proximity to the caves is great. If a little remodel was done to improve the comfort and guest service I think this could be a great place to spend a night dreaming of glow worm adventures.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw
3924,"I was with some friends staying in a hotel nearby and they wanted to come here for dinner. I decided I'd try it again as it had been about a year since my last experience. My update to my last review is unfortunately not any more positive. They no longer have a gf menu and additionally had no idea what dishes included gluten. The manager came over and was less gf aware than our server. He would say I could probably have something, then I'd ask about the sauce and he'd say well it has bread crumbs or it has flour. It was very frustrating for both me and the family I was trying to enjoy dinner with. The server did her very best with the limited information she was provided with. I settled on a steak thinking that was probably safest, and when it came it was well done instead of rare. So I had to wait for that to be refired. It was a mess. And really ruined the night for us all as they all just had to sit and watch me eat my meal at the end. I definitely cannot recommend this place especially if you have any form of allergy, they are not aware of what the ingredients in their dishes are.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw
3951,"We stopped in here for lunch this Sunday and were drawn by the restaurant's proximity to the water and review photos featuring beautiful bay windows. It has a great location with most booths boasting a lovely view of the boats outside and even on a rainy day it is still pleasant scenery. When we first came in, we asked about gluten free options. The hostess gave us the deer in headlights look I'm so fond of from my Nebraska time. She wasn't necessarily unpleasant, but also wasn't welcoming. She told us our server would help us with that. So we settled in and admired the water as we waited for our server. The menu has a good variation to it with plenty of options and we were excited to indulge in some delicious seafood. Our server was similar to the hostess in demeanor. She wasn't unpleasant, but we also felt that the gluten allergy wasn't being taken seriously. She had minimal knowledge of it and dismissively referred to gluten as rice and told us to just basically stay away from all of that type of stuff and then waited for us to put in our order. I had to prompt further and explain it can be in sauces and dressings and could she please ask the chef what would be safe for us to have. We really aren't picky, we like anything that we can safely eat! After she left to go speak with the kitchen, my little sister who has an even stronger allergic reaction than I do said she didn't feel comfortable eating here and so we left. I unfortunately cannot comment on the food, only the beautiful view and great menu options and our experience with the customer service. Wish we could have tried some of the delicious sounding menu items. It would be great if management could offer more information for their staff on gf allergies as it is becoming a more common issue in the restaurant industry. Additionally, training on the difference between someone who eats gf because they feel better or for dieting purposes and someone who has an actual allergic response I think would help improve the customer service for those of us who are forced to take gf eating very seriously.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw
3978,"The Fiance and I were really looking forward to our NYE dinner here at Dario's. From the mouthwatering sound of their regular menu items to the dynamic reviews from fellow yelpers, we thought we were sure to have bellies so full we might not even be awake for the new year (preferable way to ring in the new year). Sadly the best way to sum this visit up is simply underwhelming. We called a few days ahead and made reservations. We were seated right away which was great cause there isn't a lot of standing room in the doorway. Not to mention the funny thing about doors is that they open frequently and December in Nebraska was on the other side of it. I felt a little bad for those who had tables right near the door as even I could feel the chill in the middle of the dining room. The dining room itself is small and tables are close together. We were right in the middle and definitely felt a lot of hustle and bustle around us. Not as intimate as an atmosphere as we were searching for. The inside is very pretty though with a gorgeous eclectic look. Our server took about 30 mins or so to get to us for our drink order and then about another 20 to get our order. We were pretty much ready to start chewing on napkins; which, i would guess, are probably gluten free. Speaking of gf they are gluten aware at this restaurant and there were things on the menu that were gf. Our server just wasnt sure what they were. After checking with the kitchen it was decided I could have the shrimp bisque and the two steak entrees. They had a limited NYE menu and the variety was lacking. They had fries on a couple of the entrees and then again as one of the appetizers, and two of the entrees were lower quality sirloin or flat iron steak options. When our server did bring our food though he hesitated and had to double check that the sauce was gluten free. Luckily mine was, but my Fiance's (the other option they'd given me) actually wasn't. So their accuracy on gf reporting may be a little off.  I went with the shrimp bisque and the Boeuf Bourguignon (the sliced flat iron with red wine reduction) and the Fiance went with the wagyu sirloin. The soup came and it was awesome. Super incredibly flavorful and silky smooth texture with little shrimp bites of happiness. We had to ask for bread several times as my Fiance was just watching me eat and his crankiness status was increasing. We overheard the customers next to us put in a complaint about their sirloin and how chewy and difficult it was to eat. The person finally placed his cutlery on his plate and gave up eating..made us a bit nervous. Unfortunately when our food arrived it was not as awesome as the bisque. Sirloin was in fact very chewy and tenacious. Flavors were not on point and side of fries were unexciting. My bourguignon was not at all what it suggested. There were no slices, the texture was that of lunch meat. Incredibly paper thin ribbons and overcooked. It was..challenging to get down to say the least. I was not surprised to see many other tables next to us left their steak dishes untouched. The burger entree seemed to be the only popular one. Price was well over 100 for one soup, two entrees, and one drink. It's really too bad because it sounds like their regular menu gets really stellar reviews; however, their NYE menu selection and execution put a damper on our NYE spirits. The Fiance phrased it best, he said it was pretentious without substance. I have to agree.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw
4012,"I utilized the airport parking services here recently and left with a bit of a meh feeling. The location is a bit farther from some of the other park n go locations, which of course adds to your shuttle time. The parking is a little difficult as you have to just park in the same cramped parking lot as the guests of the inn. The morning I came up there weren't many spaces and I drive an SUV which further complicated the parking process.The shuttle was early arriving back to the motel, and everyone boarded immediately. Instead of leaving early we sat and waited and actually left 5-10 minutes after the scheduled time (which is every half hour). Pick up wasn't too complicated, but slow. I called when I got into the airport and they said someone was on the way. It took 30 minutes for the shuttle to grab me. When I got back, my vehicle had been moved to the very back of the lot and was super tough to get out of.Probably my biggest complaint was the unfriendliness of the individuals answering the phone and running the front desk. They were just a bit cranky and dismissive to everyone unfortunately. Good thing about this place is its very cheap parking!",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw
4068,"We stopped in here the other night and unfortunately only ended up ordering drinks, so we weren't able to get the full impression. Other yelpers seem to love their beers. We stopped in on a popular Friday night after trying to get into several of our local favs and finding over an hour wait, yikes! We decided to check out this place and noted there was no wait at all.. Interesting.  We were greeted and when I asked if they were gluten free friendly I got that so familiar deer in headlights look and then they assured me the server would know more. We were seated quickly to the right of the long bar. I expected the inside to have a little more of a restaurant/ brewery atmosphere but instead it reads local bar. Our server came over to grab drink orders and as usual I had to ask about allergy options. She definitely didn't know what gluten was as she recommended the pizzas.. Oh dear..She did know that they had a gf beer, but when it didn't come in a bottle so I could check the label I got really nervous about it and went to ask the bartender myself. Our server was over there also asking if it was gluten free which was a bit concerning that she double checked after serving the drink to the allergic customer.We still didn't get any clarification about food and when I asked if she could inquire with the kitchen or someone else she just said no one knew and asked if we were ready to order... SighSooo we paid for drinks, gf beer was not one of the better ones, and headed out to the freezing 'braska night to start our hour wait at one of our local favs. Overall I thought service was nice, just not well informed. And for someone with a true allergy, uncertainty like that leaves you really with no other choice but to not eat.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw
4089,"Super disorganized airport! Firstly our driver had some issues finding the terminal and we couldn't blame her. We were watching the signs and as first timers they were not very clear to us at all. After 10 minutes of looping and getting around construction we made it to the departure terminal for our airline. We checked in and were pleased to see that the security line was only about 15 people. Those 15 people took us 45 minutes to get through security! They had one person checking ids, one person on bag scans and two on one body scanner.. And about 10 other people standing around (and I'm not kidding) checking their cell phones.. So the one guy on bags was really cranky and he kept rescanning things and yelling at everyone for not laying things in quite right. And nothing major like laptops or liquids in bags but just having things not organized properly in the container. So it would go through, he'd go get it, bring it back, lecture the person and be incredibly demeaning, make them fix it in front of him, and then go back and watch it scan through before letting them move through the body scanner.. O..m..g. It was painful. And honestly there's just no excuse for treating others this way, even if you're having a bad day.We finally get through and realized this was only D gates. We had to ride a train a good 10 minutes all around the airport to get to our gate area. Once there, we were limited on food. There were a lot better options way back by security. Airport also seemed pretty dirty and undergoing a lot of construction. Not a super experience.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw
4097,"You can stop in here for a small bite once you get through security if you're in the A gates. It's a pretty small place with a few seating options and you order at the counter.They have coffee, snacks, and a few grilled items you can order. Service has generally been pretty bad and exceptionally slow, even with just getting a coffee. I remember once they had to make my coffee over three times because they kept forgetting a basic step. It was just a mocha from their regular menu, but the girl kept stopping and saying oh darn I forgot this, sorry miss I'll make it again. I was patient and had time but I can see others frustration. Many times the individual checking you out at the cashier is carrying on conversations about personal lives with someone making the coffee etc. it's not a super professional joint.I've never had food here as they don't really instill any confidence in their knowledge of their menu so I don't even bother asking about gluten free. My coffees are pretty average, so can't complain there.Prices are inflated as you'd expect in airports. It's really too bad this is the only option in the gate area. To get better eats, I'd even walk down to the runway in the icy cold 'braska winter for a food truck if they'd put one there. But sigh.. This is all we've gots.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw
4108,"We had dinner here one of the nights I stayed in Orlando and it was a bit of a disappointment. It's in the Hilton Orlando Bonnet Creek, which was pretty easy to find and the hotel itself is quite lovely.I was eating out with friends and due to my issue with 'da 'glutzens they let me pick a place that would be gluten free friendly. I called earlier in the day to check and spoke with someone who assured me they had many options that were safe and gf. Upon arriving we were seated at a high top table, chairs were pretty uncomfortable but the low lighting and ambiance is pleasant. It took a while for our server to come by and once she did she said that unfortunately there really wasn't much I could have, that pretty much everything had gluten in it- and then she walked away. Hmm okay problem solving left to me. When she came back she just asked us what we wanted.. Ignoring my allergy issue and making it a bit uncomfortable as my friends were having to wait. I asked if we could speak to someone in the kitchen and she brought out one of the chefs.He was really nice and I found out they had gf soy sauce and he could make me a couple of my favorite rolls that weren't on the menu, but yah pretty much all the hot food was off limits. Talking with him was really the best part of the meal as he was very willing to accommodate my allergy as much as possible.Once the rolls came out I had to wait quite a while, my friends were almost finished with their meals, for our server to bring the gf soy sauce and then she said their wasabi has gluten in it (which is pretty unusual).Rolls were just okay, I expected a bit better than our mediocre Midwest sushi here in 'braska, but alas I'll take my landlocked fishes instead. Price was a bit higher than average and certainly not worth the hassle.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw
4133,"I was here once with some friends, one who is from Hastings and another from Lincoln. The atmosphere is really cute and you could see it was a local favorite as it was packed with middle school kids and their families. I'm assuming it was after a sporting event. We sat at the bar and the owner chatted up my friend from Hastings and it was apparent he'd been in the business for some time and knew most customers personally.We had margaritas from a brightly colored machine which was kind of fun, but they were just ok. I had a hard time ordering anything without gluten and they weren't too aware of what the allergy involved. I figured steak was the safest thing on the menu along with some vegetables, the guy from Lincoln had the same. I think my friend from Hastings ordered fried shrimp or coconut shrimp which had always been her favorite but unfortunately I couldn't try them. The vegetable side was alright but the steak was pretty bad. Not at all prepared to the right temperature, I ate it anyway. I had to remove a lot of fat and even though everything should have been gluten free I didn't feel well the rest of the night and interestingly neither did our other friend from Lincoln who also had the steak but is not allergic to gluten. Maybe just something with the preparation. Service was friendly, portions were good, and prices seemed pretty reasonable. I may have just had bad luck with the food or maybe their best items are unfortunately things I'm allergic to, but it wasn't my fav place in Hastings.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw
4153,"I used to come in here for smoothies from time to time when I was in school nearby. I think they even catered salads and wraps to an event for us once. I stopped in here with friends for a smoothie a couple weeks ago when I was visiting. The inside of the place is pretty colorful and has the same general plastic feel of most fast food chains. My friends live close and come here a lot. They say the main reason is it's cheap and they also get coupons in the mail. They said the service is terrible though. This day was no exception because when I asked about gluten-free they just gave me a shrug and had no interest in helping me figure out if the ingredients were OK. After a lot of probing, I decided the peanut butter smoothie seemed safe.The smoothies only come in one size which makes it difficult for one person to finish and there is a lot of waste. Mine was pretty terrible, it really just tasted like watered down chemically peanut butter. So I didn't drink it. The boys liked their wraps and from what I can remember from when I had previously eaten here years ago, I used to think their salads were pretty good. But I only base my reviews off current experiences.Overall, not sure if there is much reason to eat here, unless it's pretty much just proximity and cheap prices that make it a convenient place to grab something quick.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw
4166,"I was here for the first time a couple weeks ago during restaurant week, and I wish I'd gotten a better first impression.The restaurant itself is beautiful. Walking through the Goliath carved wooden doors at the entrance made me feel like I was entering a scene from Game of Thrones. It is a very large restaurant with two beautiful bars, casual bar seating on one side and a finer dining room on the other. A lot of outdoor seating overlooking the golf course which was peaceful. The lodge theme is carried out through the dining areas with taxidermy and wood embellishments. It was pretty empty when we dined, so we were seated and served quickly. The restaurant week menu was divided into a 20.00 or 30.00 three course meal. The only gf option was the salmon so I went with the 30.00 and my friend the 20.00. Our salad appetizers were acceptable, nothing extraordinary. My salmon was about a 1/3 of a normal fillet, it was cooked well but I wasn't impressed with the purée it was served over. What really killed it for me was my friend's entree.. A single soft taco on a plate, no side, not even a garnish.. It was.. embarrassing to call it an entree. Her creme brûlée came out in a dish the size they use to serve dipping butter at Red Lobster. They were out of these little creme brûlées and since it was the only gf dessert they brought me a normal sized one.. The comparison was ridiculous. However, that being said, it was genuinely one of the best creme brûlée I've had in Lincoln! For anyone who doesn't know what restaurant week is you should check it out online! Every major city has one. Restaurants choose to participate and select what will be on their exclusive menu. There aren't any strict rules so restaurants can choose portions and types of dishes that they feature, for example many restaurants don't offer a beef dish. I dined out 7 times that week and no other place changed portion sizes. One even had a 6 oz filet on their 20.00 menu. It's meant to entice people to try new restaurants and hopefully become a regular. This is why I tried Wilderness Ridge, only my experience did not elicit a desire to return.Regular menu prices are rather expensive and the friendliness of our service was not the best. I hear from friends the food is actually quite lovely, but my experience makes me very hesitant to ever return. I encourage a revamp to next years restaurant week menu if their goal is to actually impress the new customers.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw
4176,"I was here a couple weeks ago for the first time and while there were definitely some great aspects to the dining experience there were also some pretty significant negatives. I was visiting my little sister in Carmel for my birthday weekend. Both of us are celiac, so dining out requires planning ahead. She called and found out that this place offers gf pasta, we were pretty pretty pretty excited. The restaurant is beautiful, I just love these little privately owned places in Carmel. The downstairs is beautifully decorated with an elegant ambiance. We were greeted promptly and directed to the rooftop lounge my sister had been wanting to dine in. Seating here is first come first serve and after ordering our first drink at the bar we were lucky enough to get a comfy couch right next to one of the fire pits. Despite the cold weather that night I was pleased to see that with the fire pits and heating lamps they were able to make this outdoor lounge practically cozy. The issue came when our server, who was only serving our table for some reason so he wasn't busy, first came over. He was unaware of the gf pasta my sister had already inquired about and had to check with the kitchen. The menu is not labeled for gluten allergy and there's no separate menu so ordering was extremely time consuming and we relied entirely on our server to check with the kitchen. We didn't want to be difficult, we asked what we could have and said we'd take pretty much anything that was gf cause the whole menu looked good. Our server didn't try to hide his annoyance with us and every time he walked away from our table he complained to other servers in our hearing and viewing range. It was a pretty uncomfortable experience. The food we tasted was amazing. We had the artichoke appetizer which wasn't bad. The filet mignon carpaccio was incredibly delicious. The buffalo mozzarella and salad were both amazing. We ordered the gf penne with the cream sage sauce which was super nom. We also wanted to share a meat dish. We tried to make it easy on our server (since ordering the above appetizers had already put him in a disagreeable mood) and told him we'd take anything under the meat options that was gf, all sounded excellent, so whatever the kitchen told him was safe. He brought out the lamb chop and confirmed everything was safe. My sister and I each took a bite before realizing it was served over couscous which is 100% off limits to someone allergic to gluten. He took it back and begrudgingly had it remade. The lamb was delicious and while I appreciated the 25% off he gave us for the mix up it wasn't worth how sick both my sister and I got later that night from that one bite. Not to mention it didn't make up for how rude he was repeatedly. At one point he even stopped serving us and assigned a really nice guy that was bussing tables to serve us while he leaned up against the bar and observed.While the food and ambiance are spot on here, I'd never go back. There's really no excuse to be this unpleasant to customers, especially when it's a true allergy and we really tried to be easy going. We realize it's an extra headache and neither my sis or I like to make it an issue.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw
4189,"Sadly this place was a huge disappointment service wise, though food was pretty good. Atmosphere is to be desired. Big open room packed with tables. Huge fish tanks in the back where you watch whatever you ordered get taken. Lol maybe it's just my tender heart but I've always had a hard time with that type of display, but moving on. A lot of bareness in regards to decoration etc.We had a wait but it wasn't bad for dinner on a Saturday night. Once we were seated we went to order. I thought seafood would be easy gluten free but apparently not. I was initially told they couldn't make me anything. When my friend pressed with more questions annoyed at how dismissive the server had been we finally settled that I could have a plain steamed crab with none of the sauces (it was apparently impossible to not put wheat in any of them, even the garlic and olive oil) and the scallops and vegetables plain. My friends ordered other things. The worst part is that all these things came out and I was just sitting there waiting and watching them eat for 45 mins. They finally brought the scallops which everyone ate as well. We then all sat and waited. We had to ask five.. Yes five.. Times about the last crab. Me still starving. We were blown off several times. Asked to speak to a manager twice who never came. Two hours after being seated it finally came and everyone just watched me eat. Food was good though mine was bland as they offered no sauce options, but seafood was fresh and portions good. They also charge for everything without telling you, the peanuts on the table? Yep. The tea they bring you? Bet ur bottom $When I return to Singapore I won't be rushing back.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw
4196,"Ok so I've been here a couple times and the first time wasn't that impressed and the second time was recently with a group for a birthday. The atmosphere is nice, it's rather small inside with just one main dining area. Sushi bar in the back and attractive decorating. Since the main dining room is so open there aren't really intimate areas to sit if you're wanting to quietly talk.Service isn't bad. Both times I came in for a really late dinner so I didn't have to wait long. Food usually comes out pretty quickly as well. The server I've had both times is nice but can take a while to get orders. Gluten free is really challenging here. They do have gf soy sauce which is nice, but there really isn't a lot of food choices. No gf distinctions on the menu so you have to completely rely on the server for information. The server seems somewhat aware but it's mostly a lot of - I think you can have this or um just stay away from that. Really not a ton of options aside from straight sashimi. It was difficult to find things I could eat here.I settled on the edamame, avocado roll and rainbow roll with real crab in the California roll since imitation krab has gluten.The real crab they use was very dry and super fishy tasting. Another girl ordered it as well and didn't eat it. I had to drench mine in sauce to get it down. Avocado roll was ok, but not the best I've had. The edamame was undercooked and undersalted. Prices are about the same as most competitors, but I just find the quality of food to not be great and trying to navigate the menu with a food allergy is challenging. I won't be returning.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw
4197,"Ok so came in here for lunch a few weeks ago and was really not impressed. Atmosphere is a little dive bar-y with all sorts of random stuff on the walls, a long bar, and TVs to drown out your date's unending commentary about what this weather has been doing to her hair. We were seated pretty quick since we were just before lunch. By the time we left though there was a bit of a wait, so seems to be a rather popular place on weekends. Our server was really busy but did her best to come get orders quickly and keep drinks and things filled. Our server was very nice and without a doubt the only enjoyable part of my meal. When I asked her about gluten free options she seemed unsure and said the salads, maybe soups ( -)the gluten bowl of bread, and was really uncertain on salad dressings. So she quickly offered to ask the kitchen.Kitchen responded that soups are ""probably"" fine and who knows about dressing. She was really apologetic and said it was difficult getting answers. I asked for clarification on the soup, emphasized its an allergy, not dieting for me, and if I or someone could maybe read the dressing bottles or something to be sure. Came back and said the kitchen just told her to forget all soups and all I can have is salad and they think the vinaigrette is fine. So I go with the salad without croutons. Comes out, with croutons. My friend is nearly finished with his meal and she apologetically brings out the salad sans evil gluten cubes. Btw, I was seated next to the kitchen and could even hear them giving her a hard time.. Not professional guys. Oh man, so onto the food quality, cause despite everything i'm totally willing to give credit where it's due... It wasn't. Salad was terrible. Good portion, I'll admit, but tasteless. Chef salad with some store bought mix (which had arugula in it by chance so add 1 classy point by sheer luck) a few slices of avocado and about two cases of the cheapest lunch meat ever and 'garnished' with some preshredded bagged cheese...Literally reminded me of how any 15 year old boy would make a salad if forced by mom. I picked out the arugula and avocado, did my best on the rest and finally gave up. Food wasn't expensive, but more than I'm willing to pay for that stuff. Will not be returning",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw

This is the night my 9.00 adopted kitty turned into a 1500.00 kitty... If only I could exponentially increase my own financial worth like that. The problem here is its a monopoly. This company has two locations and takes weekend and after hour calls. The private veterinarians in Lincoln do not and refer their patients here. That permits them to charge astronomical prices for relatively straight forward procedures. My tabby, Dr. Indiana Jones, apparently had been suffering from a struvite crystal blockage, not a UTI as my vet had suspected. To catheterize him at 2 am on a Sunday, give him some pain meds and monitor him till Monday morning was over 1,000... Scary crazy. The two days of monitoring my vet did on him, plus meds, two sets of blood work, and housing cost me only around 350. I'm not saying the vet care wasn't good. In fact the on call vet was very nice, gave me diet recommendations to prevent this from happening again, and the vet assistants seemed to give Dr. Indie Jones lots of attention. The facilities were clean and new as well. I also realize that after hour appointments will naturally cost more. I'm also in healthcare and my after hour appointments are also more expensive...

4214,"I stopped in here on my way to Cali hoping for something gluten free before my flight. It was pretty busy and only a couple overly stressed servers. It has a long bar, naturally as its Vegas, and then lots of little crammed in tables in booths with barely any room. My server was nice enough to point out a few things she thought I could have. There wasn't a lot of confidence as to what was and wasn't gluten free. She asked the kitchen if I could have the nachos. They said yes but in retrospect I probably should have been more careful cause I could hear there was a pretty significant language barrier. So I did go with the nachos which were pretty good. Chicken and a cilantro sauce along with the nacho cheese and jalapeños. There was a pretty good sized portion and I took some in a box with me for later. I never did end up feeling sick so I think the nachos are a safe bet here.Other notes, I did hear another customer complain of dirty silverware, mine was ok. Food came out in good time but not a lot of server attention in regards to filling water glasses or getting you anything else you might need. Price was pretty average for airport food. Overall, it's ok. I may try something different next time I'm in the airport.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw

It's right on my drive home as well so I'm always seeing their street sign with their daily specials that sound awesome. We stopped in and I asked the server about gluten free options. I wasn't very hungry and just wanted a snack. I got my classic deer in headlights look. And she informed me there was nothing I could eat. There is almost always something I can have so I asked if she would mind asking the kitchen. When she came back, obviously annoyed, she told me they refuse to serve me and have no idea what I can and cannot have. I was pretty shocked, I've never been refused service because of my allergy. It's one of my pet peeves. I know gluten free is a 'fad' now, but don't treat those of us with celiacs like we just feel like being difficult. Personally I always feel terrible for the extra trouble I cause the servers/kitchen, but an allergy's an allergy.So needless to say, I haven't been back. Furthermore the whole residency now eats at another burger place that happily accommodates my dietary needs.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw

Food has never been its selling point but I remember really enjoying the show and games. I came here a few times during high school and college and though it wasn't quite the same as a kid's experience, I still remember having a really good time. My last time was when my friend and I visited my aunt and uncle this summer. As it is a Denver visit staple I requested we go, and they really seemed hesitant. They said they recently went with my 12 year old cousin and even she was disappointed..I wasn't hearing no.. I mean this is Casa Bonita..you can't visit Denver and not go...and so we went.Well the decorations are the same. I was pleased to see they weren't clueless about gluten free, you can have the beef fajitas, but that's the only option. The food has never really been anything special here but we all feel it's gotten progressively worse. My friend literally eats anything and he didn't finish his meal. I asked if he'd help me finish my plate and his response was ""anywhere but here""... Well that pretty much says it.There was not as much entertainment, my uncle says the mariachi band isn't there as often. The actors were really unenthusiastic, I'm not asking them to be particularly good at this type of place, but at least have a bit of energy.. There also seemed to be less diving. At least black Bart's cave is never a disappointment!Overall, it seems that not just growing up has led to my less than pleasurable experience, I don't think I'll be going again anytime soon, but yet I can't help but still acknowledge this is a pretty unique restaurant.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw

We were here when we were in town for our meeting and service was pretty good. We had a big group and came in right at dinner rush and they managed to seat us quickly. Our server was nice, but didn't know very much about gluten free options. Aside from the pure seafood there isn't much someone with a gluten allergy can eat. I settled for the crab and shrimp Louie salad and my server was nice enough to let me read the dressing ingredients, but then as she brought out the food told me the kitchen informed her they then add flour to thicken the dressing... Why do that.. And could you maybe NOT do that for someone who can't have flour?? I was given oil and vinegar which was really terrible on that salad unfortunately.. I picked at the shrimp and crab, which was a generous portion, but left most of it. My coresidents and their wives had a variety of meals, the only thing I heard was that both people who ordered the crab melts didn't really like them. The others seemed relatively pleased. Prices are expensive, as is expected on the wharf. Portion sizes seem good though which helps make up for it. Service is good and the view amazing..

4249,"We started joining a group of friends here on Wednesday nights for discount margarita night. The margaritas are really good. The flavors are delicious and just the right amount of tequila in them. The only problem is the blended ones frequently are riddled with ice chunks you have to fish around. My favorite is the blended peach margarita.I also love the chips and salsa which are gluten free and I really have issue resisting them. They do have a gluten free menu which is nice but I've only ordered food once. I had the beef tacos and mazatlan nachos. Both were pretty greasy and the cheese on the nachos was a weird flavor. My bf who's a great garbage disposal didn't want it either. I also didn't feel great after I got back home, so I have some concerns about the gluten contamination with the food.Price is very affordable. Atmosphere is traditional for a little Mexican restaurant. Lots of bright colors, only about 10 or so tables. Service quality has been both good and bad depending on the server there that night. So I'll likely be coming back for chips and salsa and discounted margaritas, but I'll avoid eating here in the future",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw

Three times ordering and three times sick can't be a coincidence.I've only ordered delivery so I can't say much about the atmosphere of any of the locations. I can say that the delivery is pretty fast and the food has always come as I've ordered it. The pizza is pretty good, it's not my favorite gluten free pizza I've had but it's not bad by any means. A bit saucy for my taste. My issue is a few hours later I've had stomach cramping all three times I've had it. Last weekend it was the only thing I'd eaten the whole day, so I could finally be sure it was the culprit.It's too bad really cause I appreciate the fast service and though their gluten free pizza isn't cheap, none are, it's one of the cheaper ones in the area- 15.00 for a 10"".

4276,"Oh heavens, how to start.. I have never stayed in anything so sketchy, dirty, and overpriced all at one time. I take full responsibility for getting us into that situation by not reading the reviews on this place before booking through expedia. Well we needed a place close to the airport and that's about the only good thing about this motel, it's 2 min away from sj's international airport. I'm a fan of staying in little inexpensive places while on the road and have usually been pleasantly surprised at the great value and service I've found. This was 110 night, way more than its worth.. I guess the proximity to the airport really drives up the price.Firstly, the atmosphere is very sketch..more than sketch, I was actually really nervous and felt unsafe here, even with my dad. Lots of half dressed men just standing in open doors smoking, drinking, and watching people in the parking lot. Observed some conduct highly suspect of prostitution. Constant noise all night by people going in and out, yelling and car music. Ok.. So let me now draw your attention to the comforts of the room. While a microwave and mini fridge were included in the room, my sister pointed out the fridges proximity to the bathroom made it highly useful for organ trafficking storage.. Yah it was all laughs till it got dark out. Then we just hoped the little door lock was safe enough. Bugs in the room, sheets stained, towels so old they were falling apart. Carpet and bathroom were disgusting. Walked around the room with shoes on and was not comfortable taking a shower in the bathroom. Sooo.. I think we've established I would never stay here again. Nor recommend it to anyone unless your in the business of risky business..",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw
4281,"Well I hate to be the only one not impressed but I really gave this place a fair try before committing to this review.It came recommended by a friend when I first visited Lincoln so I stopped in and had the brisket and baked potato, very meh and I felt a little ick later on. Once I moved here the same friend wanted to go back. I ordered what she had, the pulled pork (no bun of course) and again it was fine but nothing amazing. Again that night I didn't feel so great. Then my last attempt was when coworkers raved about the burnt ends or ""meat candy"" well who doesn't think that sounds good? So I figured third time was the charm. These were pretty good but after a few bites they lost their appeal. I boxed them to take them home for later but after getting sick again that evening I trashed them.So while everyone else really loves this place I must say I gave it a fair chance but must differ. They are gluten free aware, which is nice, but it won't be making my g-free list as I question the crossover contamination. Prices are reasonable, cute inside area with plenty of places to sit, and friendly staff are some positives.. But sadly phat jacks is just not my slice of brisket",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw
4284,"To be honest we were really looking forward to this place before our trip to Phillie, but left with less than what we imagined. While our wallets were lighter, unfortunately our stomachs felt similarly.  It was a long wait for a table so when we went in we decided to eat at a table in the bar area. Therefore, i cannot really comment on the atmosphere of the dining area. We were taken pretty good care of by the bartender and only a couple times did I feel like I was really waiting for something. The gluten free options are okay, they have a few different items on their menu that qualify. The servers though were not really aware or informed when I asked any questions, the deer in headlights look has become quite common for me during this last year of being gluten free. Regardless, a steakhouse should be a pretty easy place for a g-free individual to navigate even without help. I ordered the crab appetizer which was my favorite thing I had here. It was pretty affordable and tasty. It was also quite pretty, pictures have been uploaded. The steak and lobster however, was highly disappointing for all of us. Three of us got the steak and lobster which was naturally, pricey. The sad part was that it looked as though one steak had been prepared and then sliced and divided amongst our plates..with one of my coworkers getting the last couple pieces. I had four or five pieces, one coworker also had a similar amount  and the last one had two or three pieces. Firstly, I had never seen a steak plated this way and second, well.. I just don't ever want to see it plated that way again. The lobster was also way over done. But I'll give credit where its due, the steak bits I received were cooked perfectly, and tasty. While my co-workers devoured all the bread in the basket to makeup for the lack of nom on their plates, I just had to watch them and envy their tolerance of the gluten... cause I too would have loved to nom some bread. So in short.. if you go, get the crab appetizer. If you want steak and lobster, you're better served at Outback, and your wallet will be better off as well.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw
4294,"This was the first gluten free pizza I ordered when I moved to Lincoln. The price was pretty affordable for gluten free which was nice, and the fact that they even carry gluten free pizza was awesome!We went and picked up the pizzas and everyone was friendly and the pizzas were made in a reasonable amount of time. My gluten free pizza was not my favorite that I've had. There seemed to be something strange about the cheese, it was really strong and took over the flavor of the pizza, I can't say I've ever really had a pizza eating experience like that. It also seemed greasy and was just not as appetizing as I'd hoped it would be. The regular pizza we ordered my friend said was okay but not his favorite, he suggested we try ordering somewhere else next time. Even though my gluten free pizza was pretty small (which is standard for GF, most are six slices) I only ate two slices and then gave the rest to my friend to finish since I didn't feel like eating any more the next couple of days. So it seems like some other people have had some great pizza here but my experience with the gluten free was just meh and my friend seemed to feel the same about the regular pizza.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw
4303,"So this review is going to stand out- ahem.... okay carrying on. We went to Grimaldi's our first night in Vegas this last weekend mostly because it was the only thing open by the time we got into Vegas.I'll be the first to admit that a pizza joint is no place for someone with a gluten allergy. That being said, I am surprised at how many places provide gluten free pizza...but I don't expect it. I try to avoid being a pain in the you know what to servers so I generally call ahead or just avoid these places, but this night we had no choice so I expected to graze from the salad bar. Now the skinny- We get there and I inform the server I'm gluten intolerant and ask if the salad dressings are gluten free. He simply responded- we don't have a gluten free menu. I acknowledge this and asked again if he could just have the kitchen check the back of their salad dressings to ensure they don't have gluten I'd be happy with their salad choices. He just repeated himself that they didn't have a gluten free menu and asked to take the orders of the other people at the table. I was so offended but at the same time I feel bad about my allergy so I just decided I wouldn't eat anything that night. Had it not been for my friend who went up to the hostess and asked her to please make sure their balsamic was gluten free I'd have not eaten. I was able to have this so I ordered the Mediterranean salad with no dressing and my boyfriend and I shared this with oil and balsamic. My only compliment about this salad was that it was a good portion, but we both agreed it was pretty bad otherwise. Ingredients didn't seem fresh and it was just a run of the mill salad for 15 bucks. My boyfriend had some of the pizza our friends ordered and wasn't enticed by it.Our friends did seem to enjoy their pizza and I do have to say the beers were pretty cheap as my boyfriend enjoyed a few of them to help get through the salad ;) So, seems like everyone loves this place but unfortunately my experience with both service and food was very very Meh.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw
4309,"I really dislike writing reviews like this, but according to yelp's rating guide this is the best I could give them given what happened the night we had dinner there. I'll start off with rating how I would have rated the place up until what occurred at the end of the meal. The atmosphere is really cute and decorated like a little rural German pub. Our German friends came with us and said it was straight out of a 1960's little German town. We were seated promptly and service was pretty good. There were about 6 or so tables and just one woman serving so we waited a little bit but not bad. They had quite a few gluten free options which was nice. Their gravies are not made with flour, and a few of their entrees are g-free. The food was okay, I was really hoping to be more impressed. Our German friends thought the red cabbage was pretty good but were not big fans of their schnitzel or their sausage. The sausages were gluten free so I ordered the Knackwurst and my boyfriend had the Currywurst, we liked both of them. He didn't like the schnitzel he ordered (I couldn't have it since it had bread crumbs) and my cornish game hen had been fried and was really really dry inside. The cabbage and potato salad sides were pretty good. Prices for each were very reasonable and we also had a restaurant.com card. Okay so the one star reason. I was still finishing my plate when something happened that made me concerned about the hygienic nature of the restaurant. An insect of the worst type for a restaurant crawled out from behind the mustard on the side of the table and made its way to my plate. My boyfriend tried to kill it but if anyone has ever had to deal with these critters they know how fast they are and their ability to fly doesn't help either. It scurried around for about 10 mins until he finally got it. By this point I had excused myself to the bathroom... we all paid our checks quickly and left trying not to make a scene. So, while I wasn't super impressed with the food before this happened I still probably would have come back for the sausages but after what happened I'm a little concerned about the cleanliness so I have to recommend a no go to yelp viewers.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw

Found out that they never called me or my warranty until i made them do it...so they knew all along they would charge me as this would not be covered, but didn't communicate this. Furthermore, my issue wasn't even fixed.

I believe this is outrageous because i have gotten hot sauce with my food at all restaurants before without any problems. I put the mustard back and left.

4635,"This business deserves ZERO stars.I have NEVER been so dissatisfied in a place, as I have been of this one. I have stayed here once before and was treated rudely. I had made the reservation just under ONE  YEAR in advance as to make certain to have the room I wanted next to family. I confirmed the week before and was told I was confirmed with my reservations and my request was met. When I arrived, this was not the case. They had moved my room away from my family because ""someone in 'my room' decided to extend their stay"". This is not my problem. The blonde was rude and very unhelpful. No discount was given and I had no option but to stay there as all other places were booked. No air conditioning.Mold in the bathrooms.No ventilation.Musky-Mold smell in the rooms.I gave the place a second chance mainly due to location. This time 4 separate rooms with 4 separate couples/families stayed. Again, BLACK mold bathrooms. All the same issues as before. I cracked a joke when I entered about wondering if there was a group discount (knowing full well they would say no due to my past experience), being in a good humored mood and hopeful maybe something changed. You ever know unless you ask.The blonde woman again was straight faced and in a very curt tone replied we don't do that. I did not ask any more for the duration of my stay as I wanted to stay in good spirits and know they wouldn't provide. On the day of check out, my Grandfather (who was staying in a completely separate room) took 3-1 gallon bags to fill with ice for me. He came back with 2 - 1/2 filled bags and replied this place is incredibly stingy. About 10 minutes later I go to get ice, not knowing their ""ice room"" is locked because they keep it behind the front desk. I have never needed to get ice before, both times I had stayed. I enter the main desk and ask the man behind the counter (who I am pretty sure is the owner) for some ice. He responds ""your father already came and got some ice"". I said that's fine, I would like my own bag of ice and asked him to fill it all the way up. He returns with barely 1/2 a bag. I ask him for more. He asks me if I am filling up my cooler. (It is none of his business what I am doing with the ice, I am a paying customer). I said it is for some of it, yes. He replied they don't fill up coolers of ice and returned with maybe 1/2 cup to 1 cup more max, of ice in the bag.I then responded to him that the man he gave ice to, previously and I, are in two completely separate rooms. That I am a paying customer who has stayed for multiple nights and had NO ICE any of those times. The fact that he would be so stingy with his ice is completely ridiculous and it is something I would expect more from a hotel that cost me $25 a night, not $105+tax. I told him it doesn't matter what I do with my ice. I have a toddler, am pregnant and need to fill up my water bottles. I also informed him of 4 different rooms that had been rented and no one will ever return to this place again. My Grandmother and Grandfather also had a negative experience, one of which, when they asked for an additional cot (and even offered to pay an additional fee) when checking in, the woman responded, again very curtly, we don't do that! And turned her back on my Grandmother. My Grandmother said that they had better service when staying at a $5.00/night B&B in Europe. She wanted to add they also got one tub of ice in a 3 night stay at Cap Santy Inn. My Grandfather was woken up at 10:30 PM to come and get some stuff that they were holding in the office. They were told they would hold these items until the following day as they ""were NOT in the way"". I am just so appalled that this establishment could still be up and running with such ""great customer service and being so up to code"".

I was given a three hour window which felt really long but I didn't have a lot going on so I didn't care too much about that. My only concern was the bike was being towed to a service shop that closes a little early so I wanted to make sure the bike got there in time.I called Platinum right after I received the text to verify that I was in their system and to put a note in that I would appreciate a call 30 minutes before the driver arrives since I live across town.At the three hour mark I called Platinum to check on the status of my tow. The person on the phone told me they were running about 30 minutes behind so to plan on the driver being there by 3:45pm. I was sent a website that tracks the status of the tow situation and at 3:41pm the status changed to ""In Route"". THANK YOU!!!!So now I am waiting for a phone call, which I never received. I'm checking every 10 or so minutes to see if the status changed. Nope. Eventually by 4:30pm I call Platinum again. After asking where the truck is and sharing with her that the status online says ""In Route"", she tells me that the truck is actually still at their dispatch center and the driver is not even at the dispatch center yet. AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!At this point I'm questioning whether to just cancel the tow and have my insurance figure something else out tomorrow. She assures me that a truck will be in route soon and to wait by my phone.Eventually, at 5:30pm, 5.5 hours after I was put in the system and 2.5 hours after the given time window, the driver showed up. I was given a call while the driver was in the alley which thankfully my GF was there (her house) to meet the driver because I was never given the 30 minute heads-up that I requested. Okay, bottom piece of bread. Jesus the driver was SUPER helpful and worked very hard to get my bike on the truck. The steering wheel was locked and couldn't be unlocked (ignition was gone) so he had to work hard to get the bike to roll up into the back of the tow truck. FINAL THOUGHTS: Jesus (driver) was awesome, the people at dispatch center were friendly, it takes WAY TOO LONG to get a tow which is understandable but BE HONEST AND GIVE RELIABLE TIME WINDOWS/ESTIMATES!",zriuvFjGFSjvER9OgFJCew
4839,"When I read about Frontager's pizza, I was intrigued. We were on a birthday getaway and excited to try some new restaurants. We stopped in for lunch and waited patiently at the door to be seated. The place was pretty empty, three tables of 3-4 people, but it took almost 5 minutes to finally be seated and acknowledged by the waiter/server/the only person working at the moment. Once we were seated we realized quickly that this was likely not going to be a great visit. The waiter/server/person was at the cash register using an iPad for at least 10 minutes while we sat at our table waiting to order drinks. The other three tables had no food and looked visibly annoyed as the kitchen, which was in plain sight, had no food prepped and nothing was being cooked.  The daytime manager came in and he eventually came by to take our drink order. We could tell they were way behind on orders and frantically making the food for the 3 tables that were seated when we came in. One table, which had kids, complained about the wait and took their kids to the beach to kill some time.  Once the server/waiter and the daytime manager seemed to be caught up they took our food order. Right after, the restaurant filled up. Another 3 or 4 tables filled and those tables were seated and placed orders right away. About 45 minutes into our visit, we noticed that tables who were seated after us were receiving food. Hmm? As we became more annoyed, we noticed the daytime manager gesture toward us to the server/waiter, which was clear to be a non-verbal, ""Where the hell is their food?"".Though they clearly knew they messed up and didn't put our order in, they still waited another 10-15 minutes to even start making the pizza we ordered! A pizza that literally had three toppings on it and takes 8-10 minutes to cook. Every table that was seated after us received their food (appetizers and pizza) WAY before us. In fact, one table had even paid and left.The worst part of this entire experience was the lack of acknowledgment for what had happened. I get it, a restaurant gets busy, they mess up an order, they lose a ticket...it happens! To not admit what went wrong or at least apologize and offer some kind of way to make it up, is such a poor practice for any establishment. When we finally went to the cash register to pay and leave, like I said above, we received no acknowledgment, apology, or even an offer of some type of discount or comped item. I really felt everyone working there was friendly, but the service was AWFUL. For me, some type of ownership for what went wrong could have saved my impression of the place. Unfortunately, that never happened and for that, we will never be back and can not recommend the place. Oh, last thing, the pizza was really good though. So, I guess if you are willing to risk crappy service, you'll love the food.",zriuvFjGFSjvER9OgFJCew
4842,"UPDATE: I am really sad that DDL, in our opinion, gave up on our dog and didn't try to work out any kind of situation for him that could have him find success at DDL. Our dog is tough, we get that. He adored several staff members and is GREAT with other dogs. We wish that a plan could have been put in place where our dog was taken out of the ""daycare"" when staff members he didn't know came in and he could be put back in when staff members were in that he got along with. I know, too ""above and beyond"" right? But I guess I am sad because I truly thought DDL was above and beyond. We aren't swimming in money and we were trying everything possible to get help for our dog. We had him in one-on-one training, group training, he had a dog therapist and we met with a vet to work out a medicine plan for his anxiety.DDL was his outlet to have fun and play with other dogs. It truly made my day to watch him on cam. The last straw was leaving him for 3 nights and having him stuck in a crate the entire time. Even with the ""daycare"" open and staff members working that he loved and got along with, he still was not allowed out of his crate to play. It was heartbreaking. Again, the safety of the staff and other dogs is of the utmost importance. My dog LOVED certain employees and did fine with them. Furthermore, I have never met a dog that my dog doesn't love. I only wish that a plan could have been put in place, which we would have gladly worked with, where our dog was able to come certain days, or even hours, when certain employees were working. Their lack of even meeting with us to devise a plan was beyond disappointing and made it clear they had no motivation to work with a dog who required extra planning. PREVIOUS REVIEW:The staff at Downtown Dog Lounge are beyond professional, skilled, and friendly. My thinking is any parent with school age children hope and deserve a teacher who truly cares, appreciates the diverse needs of every learner, keeps the family connected with the classroom, and supports their child with their individual strengths and challenges. The staff at Downtown Dog Lounge are no different in their approach with dogs. This isn't just a ""daycare"", this is a place where your dog can learn, grow, and you will genuinely know that your dog's unique needs are being considered by the staff. They check-in with us regularly in regard to how our dog is doing and they immediately let us know if they have any concerns. They take time to know the little details about every dog. We are truly grateful and appreciative of all Downtown Dog Lounge has done and continues to do for our dog. Thank you!",zriuvFjGFSjvER9OgFJCew
4851,"I feel compelled to write a review about this location since I very rarely feel I have an experience similar to the one I had today at Caldera. Service can make it or break it for me and I am confident I will never be coming back here again. As someone who loves visiting breweries and trying new beers I was beyond excited to taste some of the beer selection Caldera had to offer. I'm only in town for a small time so visiting local breweries is one of my favorite things to do when in a new city. We arrived and were promptly seated by a host who seemed to either be new or have no idea what he was doing. Once we were seated we were given menus and told our server would be with us shortly. A family of four was seated at a table next to us 10 or so minutes after we were seated. They also were all given menus and told their server would be with them shortly. 20 minutes went by and no one checked in with us, told us it would be a few minutes, or even acknowledged us. What sealed the deal for me on this was when a server finally came out she passed right by our table and went to the family of four who sat down after us. Again, my hopes were high for this place and I was really excited to visit. It makes me sad that this was the reality of our visit but I felt the need to write what happened. I understand mistakes can happen but first impressions are lasting.",zriuvFjGFSjvER9OgFJCew
4860,"Ah, happy hour! The few hours of the week, on Friday, that I look forward to most! It signifies the end of a hard and grueling week. It makes Friday just that much more enjoyable because I know at the end of the day a cold drink and delicious food await me.I recently moved from the U-District to the Sandpoint area of Seattle. This new move takes me directly by Mioposto as I drive home. From the first time I laid eyes on this place I knew I had to try it out! I am a pizza fanatic and the ambiance seemed inviting, fun, and relaxing. Well, today I decided it was finally time to try out the happy hour at Mioposto. I believe we had one of the rudest and least helpful servers in the history of food service. To be fair, the pizza chefs seemed great and the rest of the wait staff seemed fast and respectful. Our server on the other hand; wow. Due to our experience with this one server we will not be coming back.To start, we walked in and were the second table to be seated. The other table only had two people. We sat down and upon him bringing us menus I felt he immediately judged us or wrote us off as people he did not want to help. Anyways, we place our drink orders. Super simple; a happy hour house wine and a draft Manny's. The server leaves as we contemplate the pizza options. Maybe one other table is seated. We wait for the drinks. And we wait some more. A few more tables are seated and more servers are beginning to work with other tables.He comes to our table five minutes after our drink order to take our food order. I ask if the drinks are coming and he informs us that the bartender needs to make them. Ummmm, okay. We place food order and we wait another five minutes for the drinks to finally come. He ended up pouring them, which was confusing because the bartender never did. Food comes out and it was delicious! He didn't check in once with us to see how our meal was. The next time we saw him he handed us a check. What bothered us the most was the fact that other tables, and tables who were seated after us were given drinks WAY before we were. The server never checked in with us to see if the pizza was good or that we were doing okay. He did not give off a friendly vibe at all and was very unpleasant to have as a server.",zriuvFjGFSjvER9OgFJCew

We made sure to bring it in clean with the hope that they could spend more time doing a thorough detail but that backfired. I'm sure all they did was sit in the car for 30 minutes, playing on their phones and making sure to breathe hard so the windows looked foggy like a real deep clean had taken place.

4910,"Yes the staff is fairly friendly, but I do not think this justifies my experience. I felt I was expected to understand how the process of a spray tan works, even though it was my first time, and the lady helping me did not care to explain anything. No one told me before getting tanned I should be home by 1.5 hours to rinse off, or risk getting ""very dark"" when I wasn't planning to go home after b/c I had a class, so I had to skip it. People make mistakes, and I understand people are busy/tired so don't explain things at times. I was able to move on, but I checked my email (expecting the receipt), however it was an erroneous email stating I didn't show up for my appointment, when I clearly did. I called to ask about it and they apologized, and said they would immediately email me my receipt. I also asked to double-check that my 2nd spray tan appointment, which was made the day before my wedding, however she said it was NOT made. I was so upset that they have made mistake after mistake. But because the lady on the phone was apologetic I was willing to still come for my 2nd appointment. However, she failed to keep her promise that she would IMMEDIATELY email me my receipt, confirmation of appointment and manager's contact. I still have not received an email.

The lady on the phone said they could re-deliver at a time I would be home, so I asked for Monday at 6:30pm since I wouldnt be home until then. I come home and the note indicates they tried delivering at 11:45am (around 7 HOURS BEFORE WHAT I REQUESTED). I called again and they said they can never promise any delivery times.

I love getting pastries from coffee shops b/c this one was so disappointing - not much texture to the muffin and had that artificial sweet taste. I got my bf the sausage egg ciabatta and the bread was soggy, there was so much cheese that I felt the cheese was just used to overpower the taste of the sandwich. The coffee was below average in my opinion as well, I just got a drip coffee which had a burnt taste.

First of all it cost $6.50 (and in comparison to Lee's which is my average go-to comparison - charge around $4, 5 at the most). The sandwich was horrible - bread was stale but they cover it up by re toasting it. There was no veggies but a few slices of radish, no picked carrots or cilantro which is what makes a BANH MI SANDWICH. This is also a side comment in that I asked for no mayo and still came with it, tried not making a big deal about it but since I am ranting anyway, thought I'd include that as well.

5004,"Been here quite a few times, convenient and decent quality ingredients. This 2 Star is primarily based on yesterday's poor service.  You may ask what type of poor service?  Well, the front door is the first experience a customer has.  And the moment we enter and say 5 people, this pretentious kid host gives a smartass remark like he has to check and its a bother for him.  Mind you theres 9 OPEN tables in the dining room (I counted).  Kids these days (not all) think and act like everything is owed to them and this one was no exception.  We said, ok, well we can easily walk out as you're making it like its ""Our privilege to dine here"" was about to smack the smile outta this ......Anyways, he realized we were not to be trifled with and quickly said brb, put a table together and smile and said ready.Our waitress while nice and smiley, but was SLOWWWWW.  There was no sense of urgency.  Our waters were refilled well enough (good), but the molasses speed at which she moved getting our food off the kitchen heaters was unimpressive.  You may say why did we notice that?  Well, the kid at front put us in a bad mood already and we started watching other details.  We ate, food was decent as usual.  Plates cleared in a timely matter.  Then the long long wait for the check.....man.  The new dish braised short ribs gnocchi was good for the first few bites.  Midway through though was too salty and the dish was small to begin with, but glad it was bigger by the end if you know what I mean...More sense of urgency is needed, more training for front desk particularly this host from yesterday.Good Luck to them.",DVHeHJWyDetbsfVKre886A

5054,"THE DEATH OF THE GREATEST BURGER.  (Pokemon flavor)***We have been here a million times.  From post golf outings, to celebrations, to business dinners/lunches in the main dining and in the lounge for HH.Let me first say this new 2 star review is based SOLELY on the HH menu and specifically their  famous burger.  I am sure this has been recommended before, but YELP should definitely setup a separate review section of a restaurant's main dining vs. their bar/HH since the bar/HH is such a big deal these days.John Howie started out years ago as a premium cut, all different types of Wagyu beef steakhouse.  A high end, beautiful establishment (still) with great service and management (still).  The steaks remain top notch along with their service and we will for sure continue to consider JH when steak is on the brain.Another huge part of JH was their famous bacon burger, IMO the best in state for the past 7 years.  The lounge was always packed because of this burger often having 30 minute wait in line situations.  I can't say enough about the burger as everything was top notch quality from the beef, the buns, the veggies, the bacon, the cheese, and the size (huge) for $10-now $12 it was the best deal in town.  Usually you associate size with lack of quality (like a buffett) but this burger while huge never short changed you.  It was the perfect eat half and bring the other half home juicy ass scrumptious burger.Now (as of last night), the greatest burger is now dead.  Clearly, JH chose to downgrade their meat.  It is definitly not the same anymore, hell it wasn't even picture worthy to show how terrible it is now.  We were all crushed.  You know that moment of realization pikachu is there for the catching and you toss that ball and mid flight PIKACHU RUNS AWAY?  Yea, that was this moment.....such disappointment.  We all had a moment of silence.  It's like we all had Dragonite in our Pokedex already and then for some reason he disappears?  How can that happen?  We already got the best!  And he leaves?  Now we have to go find him again?????  That is how the JH burger was......2 of us order burgers.  It was not finishable.  For kicks I ordered myself one to go thinking maybe bad chef, bad/old beef, benefit of doubt after all these years, but nope, mine was just inedible too.  The color of the meat has a gray look, its no longer rich brown, nowhere near as juicy, nowhere near top quality.  Still huge, but now with the short change.  RIP JH burger, we wont ever be coming back for HH.  It's like they did this on purpose too deciding that HH was not a profitable part of the business.  They did this to the Habanero Shrimp 3 years ago too.  That was also the bomb diggity and then they changed the shrimp and no longer the diggity just like the burger.  I guess we'll Diglett somewhere else now for that Dragonite burger.SIGH.........................................................................",DVHeHJWyDetbsfVKre886A
5065,"2.5 Stars.  I would round up to 3, but can bring myself to do it even though the bartender was cool and kept wanting to make sure everything was fine.Its so hard reading 4-5 Star reviews for anything because it just hypes up your own expectations.  When I read high reviews, I also read the low ones.  And unfortunately, I side with the low reviews here.Main reason for the 2.5 Stars, just overpriced.  The food was not bad, but just not matching the price whatsoever. Many of the low reviews state the small portions, and yes, the rolls are small.  Not tiny small, just small.  I don't mind small portions for high prices at all, it just needs to be high quality if its going to be a small portion if you know what I mean.  The lobster is not high quality.  I want to be clear, it is not low quality, it's just not worth $19 for a roll.  If you've had good lobster, you will know it once you bite into the lobster here.  Where would I value this roll at?  $12.  But you know what, more power to them, go get your money LobsterME.  If people are willing to pay it, then you do you.  I applaud you.The Chowder fries were not bad.  I agree the fries here are good, nice and crispy with good potato taste.  But $7 to add on the chowder fries and a drink to make the whole meal $26???Hell to the NAW.",DVHeHJWyDetbsfVKre886A

5078,"2.5 Stars. Sigh.......I was so ready to do my first 5 Star food review. The flood of super positive reviews got me hyped though I know better to expect the world when you see food/movie reviews getting rave reviews. First, this low score is primarily based on the HOUR long wait AFTER we ordered. Called ahead to say we had a party of 6 arriving approximately at 1:15pm, which we did. They said it would be no problem as we waited maybe 2 minutes and was seated.  Restaurant full at arrival. We order within 5 minutes. 4 Carne Asada, 2 Chorreada, 1 Vampiro. Bunch of beers, Orange Fanta.  Everything hunky dory, we grab our hot sauce, habanero, onions, radish, cilantro from the bar. All of it fresh looking and tasting (once the food came).  Again, the 6 of us waited an hour for food to arrive.  Carne Asada:  Good. Not life changing, not mind blowing, but good. The grilled cactus was somewhat like flat green pepper but more of an acquired taste. Sausage was good, tortillas, beans, sauce. All tasted GOOD. But I would say it is more like skirt steak, thin, slightly dry and chewy. We all had to ""work"" at eating the steak. Again, whole dish was good. Would I drive ""out of the way"" and wait 20 minutes for it after ordered?  Yes.  30 minutes?  Borderline. 1 HOUR?  Absolutely NOT. Chorreada, Vampiro very good and tasty. The wrapper was of good quality, meat, potatoes were on point. Delicious. Staff:  Very friendly. Servers, cooks. All good vibes. Apologized for the wait. Cleanliness:  Clean. Kitchen clean, grills new (albeit small).  Bathroom clean (1 bathroom). Big screen TV, great Mexican music going. It pains me to give it 2.5 Stars. The wait was excruciating. Maybe we hit that rare time at the perfect moment, hopefully rare. Will I give them another chance?  Absolutely Yes. Food and staff were great quality. But man it was a total buzz kill today. They need bigger grills to keep up. There were alot of long faces on other tables. People will be flooding them due to positive reviews. I hope they can ramp up for it. If the food came within reasonable time (20-30minutes), I would have given 4 Stars.",DVHeHJWyDetbsfVKre886A
5092,"2.5 Stars.  Everything is a bit overly salted, presumably to fill your stomach faster so you eat less if you order the all you can eat.  Make sure to drink lots of water (although that fills you up even faster ;))Don't get me wrong, if you are famished, had a long day doing strenuous activity, this will taste just fine with all the protein, grease, and decent side dishes.  After all, you do bbq for that juicy fat right?  2.5 Stars is exactly what it is, ""Meh, I've had better.""  But after a full day of golf, 36 holes, this certainly filled our appetites.  It's just that feeling after you're done you think.....""I could have filled my appetite in a better way.""The price is ok for the all you can eat, and that is what drives people back.  So they did well in matching price to quality.I've been here twice.  The best part of this restaurant to me was the service.  The Korean ladies are generally friendly and fast.  Even at busy times, they did not slow down to make sure everyone is taken care of as fast as they could.  Kudos to them.",DVHeHJWyDetbsfVKre886A

5124,"I expected a buffet in a nicer Las Vegas casino to be better than the buffets that are cheaper and in smaller casinos than in the Seattle area, but I think my expectations may have been a bit too high!Once we actually found the buffet, having reservations made getting a table a breeze. If you're hellbent on trying this buffet like I was, I would suggest making a reservation from their website. It uses OpenTable and doesn't cost anything, you pay for your meal when you get there and you get to use the VIP entrance to the side of the buffet... which they should mention in their reservation process.The concept of this buffet is very charming and intriguing, I wanted to explore each station as it represents a region in France. You'd have a hard time finding much that was actually a French dish but I understand that they cater to wider audience. Nonetheless, I wanted to spend our money there.When it came to the actual food, that was a bit of a disappointment. Most of what I had on my plate was lukewarm. Even soups being held at the buffet bar were lukewarm. Any dish that included a protein severely lacked in that protein. For example, their chicken lemon artichoke rice pilaf had wonderful flavor but very little chicken. Same goes for their paella, lots of great rice but very little seafood. Their portions of prime rib and other roasted meats were slivers of what their website shows. Also that station's carver was almost rude in her demeanor when she served you, didn't listen to you, just put something on your plate whether you asked for it or not. I don't know about you, but I definitely do not enjoy that attitude. My husband was intrigued by the crab but the crab legs were so skinny, there was barely any meat in them.Service wise, we barely got any attention from our assigned server. We got one refill for our drinks and looked around for him for more but he was nowhere to be found. Same goes for our empty plates, those were not picked up as quickly as other buffets have done in the past. A lot of the stations did not have tags on each dish either. One station in particular had something I would never have guessed was apple compote, in fact I stayed away at first but once I was able to ask what it was, it was pretty good!Don't waste your money here looking for a great Vegas buffet experience, this is not it. The food was decent but the combination of the people manning each station, the lack of attention to detail on something as simple as a label and temperature/general lacking in the food really was disappointing. It could be great with a little work on simple things.",IjD-aHzIdFXWUGCaKCMZKw
5125,"Please do not waste your time on Southside Pizza. I placed an order for delivery and received it just a few minutes shy of 2 hours after placing my order. If you're too busy to take orders, tell the customer! Give them the option of taking their business elsewhere for the night instead of losing it forever with horrible customer service. After waiting for 2 hours, we were disappointed to find our directions were not read. This led to wasting our money on a salad because extra onions were added to it instead of no onions. Onions added throughout a salad do flavor the lettuce it is sitting in. To top it off, this pizza was bland. I'm glad I got this curiosity of mine out of the way. I should have known better from the smell of burnt pizza in the air from their side at Beer Star. I also asked for a manager to call me back and never got a call.",IjD-aHzIdFXWUGCaKCMZKw
5137,"Brunch today at Schooner was a disappointing experience. We both ordered the Meat Scramble and a side of bacon and the only thing that was hot and made to order seemed to be our bacon. The eggs in the scramble were cold but somehow the sausage was lukewarm, which doesn't seem like the dish was made to order. Same for the potatoes, lukewarm as well. That part I understand though, that preparation takes time and I don't expect that made to order. I do expect them to be fully reheated though, which wasn't the case. All of that aside, the flavors were there, we just needed our food to be warmer.Aside from the food, the drinks we ordered lacked as well. The bloody beer was bitter and too hoppy for a bloody beer, the mix lacked seasoning as well. The coffee didn't seem to be fresh either, when our server mentioned making a pot for me. It was served to me lukewarm and with an apology for not having cream or sugar. Our server didn't charge us for our drinks for this, which we appreciated but I would have rather had a warm meal.We were going to be hosting a group for dinner there in a few weeks. This was our reason for stopping by, we wanted to try the food first. I spoke with a manager who assured me of our reservation and that he would get back to me with further details. I never heard from anyone, even after following up with them. I'm glad we had this experience now instead of being disappointed later on during a special occasion.",IjD-aHzIdFXWUGCaKCMZKw
5150,"We had high hopes for these Tortas but ended up disappointed with the Cubana Tortas we ordered. The portion size was generous but overall the sandwich was bland and I thought mine tasted a little stale. If it wasn't for the sauces on the table, the sandwiches had no heat or flavor to them. I saw chorizo in my torta but definitely didn't taste. With bland food and $30 for 2 Tortas, we won't be coming back.",IjD-aHzIdFXWUGCaKCMZKw
5152,"On paper, Girardi's looks like a good bet if you're deciding to try a new Italian restaurant but in reality, the disappointing service left me wishing we went to Bucatini's instead. Unfortunately, the other Yelpers had it right on this one. I was hoping they were wrong!Right away my friend and I were made to feel uncomfortable. We waited 15 minutes to be seated at a table that we noticed was empty the moment we walked in. Not that we have a problem with waiting but we thought it was odd. While we were waiting, it was obvious we were getting in everyone's way and that made us feel uncomfortable. We smiled apologetically at servers walking by us and it seemed to me that we were met with annoyance on their part. It's not our fault your restaurant doesn't have a waiting area. We would have gladly waited outside if you would have come and let us know our table was ready. Once we were seated, our server took our drink order and said she would be back with some water. Apparently the bar forgot about our drink order so she came back to let us know they were finally making our order now, saying this round was on them for mistake. That was definitely a nice gesture but if she came back to us with some water, it would have been even better. We finally got our drinks about 30 minutes after we placed our original drink order. No water though, we had to ask for that again. Unfortunately the sangria tasted more like blueberry wine than an actual sangria. In looking at the menu, the prices seemed all really reasonable. We ordered some deep fried green beans, deep fried elote corn bites, Caesar salads, our entrees of pork marsala and penne carbonara followed by dessert of strawberry champagne cheesecake and tiramisu. The appetizers were about $5 each, with salads at $4 each, entrees around $8 and dessert $5 each. Really reasonable right? We decided to splurge and try a bit of everything we wanted that night because of it. When our apps arrived, we still had not been given silverware but that was OK. The deep fried green beans and corn bits didn't require them, but still, at least a napkin would have been nice. It wasn't until we received our salads next that we got utencils and napkins. The apps were decent, not mind blowing by any means. I expected to the aioli to have some bite to it, I expected some garlic in there but instead it just seemed like someone just squirted some sriracha into some mayo and called it a day. I hoped the deep fried corn bites would have some firmness to them but the corn was overdone and turned to mush. Savory mush, but mush with a deep friend exterior nonetheless. Our Caesar salads were decent. I hate deconstructed salads with a passion but I didn't mind it in this case with our Caesar salad. The dressing may have been homemade but it seemed like something out of a bottle to me, that homemade touch would have made it much better in my opinion. I normally hate anchovies and didn't even mind one spread out across my salad in this case. I would have gladly had more of this salad in lieu of the appetizers.Finally our entrees arrived and we understood why the prices were so reasonable, the portion size really left something to be desired. It looked more like a lunch sized portion than dinner. With that said, our entrees were really good. The carbonara had a very runny, thin sauce that I got all over me but it was very tasty. If it were thicker and had a touch less salt, I could eat that carbonara for days. My friends pork marsala was also very tasty. The main course was definitely better than their appetizers, if they only charged a couple bucks more and upped their portion size, it would be perfect! Hell, I would have had no problem paying $15 for that bowl of pasta if there was more of it. As for dessert, it was OK, nothing to write home about.The last thing that bothered me about this experience was the server when she came to collect our receipts after we signed them. It felt like she was trying to rush us out of there, she apologized saying she needed to get back to her child so it was obvious she was trying to get out of there. I understand she had a family to get back to but we were not holding anyone up from closing. Yes, we were there almost until closing but she didn't have to rush us out after the shitty service we received.Yes, this is rather long winded, I know. The point here is that the service failed us with our first time at Girardi's. It's really a cute place and on a hot summer night, the outdoor patio was a nice treat. Unfortunately the corner we were seated in also meant we were forgotten most of the time. The food is decent and very reasonably priced. Apparently we were there during happy hour. It is possible the pricing we read was all happy hour pricing but we were given both the regular dinner menu and the happy hour menu. In looking at both of them, I didn't see a difference. If you come in with low expectations, you may be in for a surprise.",IjD-aHzIdFXWUGCaKCMZKw
5153,"Sometimes a person craves shitty Mexican food, the kind that you know you'll regret the moment you eat it because it's a gut bomb in the making. When I tried Viva Mexico, I just wanted an ooey-gooey platter of nachos and was ready to accept my consequences. So I ordered a platter of Nachos Mexicanos and waited while I enjoyed the smell of fajitas in the air.What I received was an abomination to nachos everywhere, and a huge disappointment. The major offense: the tortilla chips were burned. How they even thought of serving this is beyond me. Then they barely had any cheese on the nachos, a core ingredient of the dish. What was on the platter was no longer ooey-gooey but burnt to a crisp as well. Next, the garnish. The way the onion was chopped made me feel like I was eating a whole onion on each chip. Obviously that's an exaggeration but a finer chop would have been appreciated. I barely had any chopped tomato and the dollops of  sour cream and guacamole were barely there as well. Not to mention, I could see clear to the bottom of the platter before I even dug in.I have friends that love this place and apparently you need to know what to order. I don't know about you but if a Mexican restaurant can't master nachos, what's the point of even trying anything else? At least it wasn't a major meal and I didn't spend that much money there. While my service was fast and friendly, it is not enough to make me want to come back.",IjD-aHzIdFXWUGCaKCMZKw
5155,"We ordered from China Best Wok last week and had such a bad experience that we will never be ordering from them again. Hopefully I can spare someone else the awful experience.We placed our order through Eat24 and it said our wait time was 45-60 minutes. After 30 minutes, we received a call from Eat24 saying one of our items was sold out and asked if we wanted to pick something else. We chose another entrée and waited for our order. We expected the order about 30 minutes later but it arrived an hour later instead.When our order was finally delivered, we realized that half of our order was wrong. We originally wanted Beef Pad Thai but when they sold out, we replaced it with Twice Cooked Pork. We also ordered a Special Plate, which was a selection of appetizers including egg rolls, BBQ pork and crag rangoon along with Sesame Chicken and BBQ Pork Fried Rice. I opened the bag and discovered a mess, there was sauce on everything and it was leaking out of the bag. I had to grab a garbage bag to be able to set the food down without getting anything else dirty. That was very offputting, there was no care in the packaging whatsoever. The container with the rice was open and there was rice everywhere, not the way I wanted to receive my order at all.When I was finally able to open each container, we found our Special Plate had a couple egg rolls, some fried rice, a few slices of BBQ pork and almond chicken. Who puts almond chicken in an appetizer? The BBQ pork was dark as if it was old and very dry. The egg roll was practically mush, very unappetizing. When we opened what we thought was our Twice Cooked Pork, we found the source of the sauce coating all of the containers. There was practically a head of cabbage with some sort of sauce and a few pieces of pork. This is not at all what we expected. The Sesame Chicken wasn't bad but it was more batter than anything else and the rice just seemed old. Overall, the food and entire experience with China Best Wok was just very unwhelming. There was no effort to package the food carefully, much less get it to us in a reasonable time frame. Perhaps they should consider getting rid of delivery until they can make better food.",IjD-aHzIdFXWUGCaKCMZKw
5156,"The way the staff at Grease Monkey conducted themselves on Sunday really got under my skin so I figured I should share my experience so that others researching them have a heads up. I went into this Grease Monkey location because of a coupon in my local Valpak, I did not intent to spend more than $50 on an oil change for my 2009 Toyota Corolla. Their coupon was for around $25 (can't remember the exact amount) for an oil change for ""most"" cars, my car is not atypical. The man checking me in told me I had no choice but to go with the $89 oil change because I had synthetic oil in my car. When I told him I wanted to go elsewhere, he told me it was too late as the oil was already drained from my car. This is my 1st issue, I didn't authorize them to do this without going over pricing first. At that point, I had to spend my money there and they forced me to do that. My 2nd issue with them is that they lied in more ways than one but the main lie is that I couldn't use regular motor oil in my car. Pennzoil dispels the myth that you can't go back to regular motor oil after using synthetic. The key thing to know about this is that synthetic lets you go longer between oil changes; 7,000 to 10,000 miles between oil changes as opposed to 3,000 to 5,000 miles for regular motor oil.  I watched them peddle this lie to a few more customers, one woman and I were definitely in agreement that we were not ever coming back.My 3rd issue is they nickel and dimmed me then scared me attempting to get more money out of me. According to their coupon, changing the oil filter is included in their service. They charged me extra in my case, I've uploaded photos. As for scaring me, they showed me pictures of what is supposedly my transmission fluid. When I asked what it should look like, the tech came back with a sample of mine that was darker than what she first showed me and then a sample of what it should look like. The way this exchange was handled was shady, suddenly my transmission fluid is worse? The circled dot in the photo is the one she showed me first. Not to mention she stressed how urgent the issue was when it really is not as dire as she made it out to sound. I'm filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, I want a refund for the extra charges they made me pay and I will stick with Jiffy Lube up the street for my needs.",IjD-aHzIdFXWUGCaKCMZKw

Now there are new owners with higher prices and fewer options for a reasonably priced evening.I love the trivia, Gonzo is the only reason I came back but last night I paid $20 including tip for an average Cobb salad, my friend paid $6 a can for PBR and my other friend paid less for his French dip.

What was once a decent option in Ballard is now ruined because of their service.I waited about an hour for a scramble, hash browns and some bacon. During that time, I was offered more coffee only once. No one bothered to say they were running behind. If I knew that, I would be OK with it. When I did ask for an update, I was told a few minutes and my food arrived 20 minutes later.Sorry Ballard Bridge Cafe but you lost a customer. A little communication and a paying even just a little bit of attention to your customers goes a long way. The gal who brought my food did apologize when I was paying my check as they told her I was in a rush and tried to give me a gift card but I declined it.

5165,"I'm only updating this review because I wanted to respond to the salon owner's comments. I feel like Kelsi is trying to blame me and say I got services I didn't really pay for when that's not the case and I don't appreciate it. Also, I don't have to ask anyone for permission to share my experience with any business here on Yelp.After consulting with other hairstylists, I'm told it is very common to use a toner after lifting color from hair, which is what Molly told me she did. In fact, when I asked about the extra cost, her explanation was that she used a lot of bleach. So then which is it? Extra services or bleach? I also told her manager I received the same ballpark quote for my hair by someone in her other location in person. The salon coordinator made an excuse for it by calling her inexperienced. I felt that was in bad taste. Getting the same quote in person and on the phone seemed like a safe bet but apparently not.I felt good about the exchange I had with the salon manager after I posted this, I even agreed to remove the review, I was just waiting to get to a computer because I couldn't figure it out on my phone.  In the meantime, I received a comment on my blog slandering me and the information in the comment made it clear to me it was someone in the salon. They denied it but tracing the IP address leads back to Seattle and it was just too big of a coincidence. I mentioned to the stylist that I had one, not any more specific than that, then I get a comment? See why I am suspicious? Yes, the salon did everything they said they would do. They also offered me 2 other visits to try and make me happy but why would I return after the first experience? Why would I return to a salon that humiliated me? I haven't taken them up on their offer nor will I, I wouldn't feel comfortable knowing someone in that salon was trying to slander me online. I would rather pay others to give me a better experience. I stopped communicating with the salon after this, I was too upset to deal with it so I did not respond. It is only now that I am reading the response from the salon owner that I am adding to this.I also wanted to add that while I walked out happy with my look, I was not happy with the condition of my hair. My hair is totally fried now. I've spent more money on hair masks in the last 2 months than I have in years. I've had color lifted from my hair before, brighter blonds than I was given at Grow, without this sort of damage.",IjD-aHzIdFXWUGCaKCMZKw
5174,"In honor of Pi day, I ordered a pie from Patxi's for the first time and it was a disappointment. I ordered a Favorite with bacon and a small Butter Lettuce salad.An hour after I got my pizza, the disappointment began. The $6 salad I ordered was small and pathetic, and came with blue cheese - which I asked to have removed. This was way overpriced and a let down.Then the pizza...I've had this style of pizza before so it's not that I don't know better but this crust was way too thick for my taste, so thick that the dough wasn't cooked through. Then it was drowned in pizza sauce, drowned. I also asked for bacon on my pizza and was charged extra for it. I couldn't taste it, or most of the ingredients for that matter. Very few mushrooms and olives where found, I absolutely hate it when a place skimps in the toppings department. The excess of tomato sauce hides that pretty well.I will say that the order arrived in the delivery window by a friendly driver and the pizza was piping hot but this lackluster experience was my first and last with Patxi's.",IjD-aHzIdFXWUGCaKCMZKw
5175,"I called Harris Ford yesterday after I saw a car I was interested in. I already had my approval and just wanted to drive the car and see if it was a fit. I dealt with Martin and he asked that I fill out a credit form to get started, I stupidly did what he asked. At the time I made the appointment to see the car the next day, the car was available.This morning I get a call from Harris Ford's other company the Money Mart, otherwise known as Bill Pierre Ford, from someone else trying to get me to work with them. I tell him I'm already working with someone and tell him the car I'm looking at. He tells me he doesn't see it in their inventory. Besides being frustrated that they shared my information, I'm now angry that Martin has not contacted me to tell me the car is no longer available. I called Martin and he couldn't answer my question, whether or not the car is on their lot, he starts poking holes in my financing plan and blaming the problem on that. He says he will call me back but he never does. Until this point, he was really good about communicating with me. Since I was nearby, I decided to head to Harris Ford early. Multiple people page Martin but he doesn't respond and meet us. Meanwhile we ask a few other people about the status of the car. One man asks us for a stock number and I watch him pretend to check his inventory. At this point no one will tell me if they have the car. When we finally walk into the main dealership, there's Martin with a shit eating look on his face. This is when he tells me they sold the car at 11am, my appointment was at 1.One thing I learned today is that Bill Pierre and Harris are the same company. Had I known this before, I would not have contacted them. This company is full of salesman (and mechanics - experience with them from work) that provide horrendous customer service and act like predators trying to con people into buying cars they can't afford. I've walked out of Bill Pierre Ford for this very reason in the past. I really believe that the car was the bait to lure me to the dealership and they would try to get me into a new car. I left Harris feeling that like this may be business as usual for them.Even though I felt deceived, I'm glad I went there.

My chicken came with no sweet and sour sauce and it's over cooked and dry with more breading than chicken. The chow mein has no real vegetables, a bean sprout or 2, egg and some bland somewhat slimy chicken. No cabbage? The kicker is that they blame me for their late delivery because I gave them the wrong street number, I think I know where I live. I repeated my street number a few times because she got it wrong. I got a call an hour after I placed my order asking for my address, they had the next block over then my order showed up 10 minutes later. When I asked what typical delivery time was, they said 30 minutes but I called after they closed.

5183,"I ate at Zoopas many years ago and had fond memories of it. When I was invited to a media preview this year and couldn't make it, I was bummed because I remembered the old Zoopas. Months later I finally make it out there and it was a massive disappointment and a very sad place.It starts at the salad bar where you have old lettuce and empty salad dressings. Is ranch not a salad bar staple? Because it was empty and it was obvious no one checked on the status of the bar regularly. Bacon? None of that either. Then you move on to dessert, which I found oddly placed. There's then a station with both pasta salads and desserts in one bar...and without labels of what is what.Then we moved on to the hot pasta and soup station. The noodles were all cold and the sauces that accompanied them barely warm. Then there were 5 or 6 soups and only labels for 3. I had to open and inspect each one to try and figure out what each was. I settled on a tomato bisque and there was barely any left. At this point I start expressing my frustration with this place with my guest. A kid from the kitchen decides to mess with me. He says ""are you displeased with something?"" I tell him everything I try to go for is practically empty and smart ass says ""obviously not if you're still getting soup"". Really? That's the take away? I tell him I'm not dealing with his crap and move along. At this point I want to drop my tray and walk out because this place is horrendous but I feel guilty that I put food on the plate.We go and look for a table, most were dirty and food particles had been caked in the table so we settle for the least dirty one. We start eating and realize what a sham this place is. When the manager makes his round checking on guests, all I could do is say fine so I wouldn't get into all the issues. My problems with Zoopas is probably something he can't control anyhow, the owners should definitely know though, which is why I'm writing this here.Zoopas claims they make their food from scratch and use organic ingredients. I'd like to call bullshit on those statements. I had some mashed potatoes with gravy and they clearly came from a box. Homemade mashed potatoes have some lumps and taste fresh. The gravy looked like brown jello is was so shiny and gel like. You call that organic? Perhaps the vegetables were but that's about it but when then, highly doubtful. The ambiance is awful. They are roped off areas where seating hasn't been finished, dirty tables, cafeteria trays that look like crap as if they were older that the restaurant itself, barely any customers inside so it can't be usage. This really made me wonder what the opening was like, if it was any better or the same old same old.By the way everything I wanted was empty, labels missing from a lot of their offerings, dirty tables, lack of customers and quality of food, shows me that this place only puts up the minimum amount of effort. It's a very sad place and I was beyond embarrassed that I took someone there with me. But hey, check in and get a free soda...a free flat soda.I seriously question the validity of positive reviews this place for recently.",IjD-aHzIdFXWUGCaKCMZKw
5184,"This salon is awful and I've only continued to go there because it was convenient.1. They do not carry new brand collections. Want the newest OPI shade? You'll need to bring it yourself.2. Service is super inconsistent. One gal may do a decent job but the next one just took 2 steps back. And they don't really listen to you, I've had to ask them to simply cut my toe nails on several occasions. 3. The condition of the implements is questionable. I've never seen someone unwrap a tool from the sanitizer (whatever you call it). They may use a new block to file your heels but they don't use a new file to shape nails, at least that I have seen.4. Quality of lacquer is also questionable. I can't say this is fact but I strongly believe they dilute their lacquers. My pedis always chip and dry super quickly, makes me think they water down the formula.5. They don't take complaints seriously. I don't think I've made unreasonable complaints but the few times I've had issues, no attempt to resolve them was made.The owner is constantly walking the floor and her demeanor really leads me to believe these women fear her. I've seen her tell customers several times that there is no wait only to make them sit in the chair with their feet soaking for a long time.

5185,"After being contacted by Liam's and offered a gift card to try them again, we went back and tried them again. I went back with guests on Monday night and had the worst service ever, bad enough that I didn't even tip the man and I don't do that lightly because I take pride in tipping people well.It started with his offer for a sample of wine, which we declined. I don't like wine so I was going to order a different drink but after a noticeable change in attitude after that, I changed my mind. It seemed like he thought we weren't going to spend much money and his tip wasn't going to be that much so why even bother with good service.From that point on, we spent much of our time at Liam's neglected. We kept trying to get his attention for water refills and he ignored us most of the time... he gave us more water once. As he was being attentive to other tables around us, he kept knocking into the back of one of our chairs, which was rude because he didn't bother apologizing and there was plenty of room for him to move around in. It really seemed like a deliberate move each time.Part of the issue we had with our meal the first time was the fishy smelling crab in one of the salads we ordered. It's obvious the crab wasn't fresh but the flavor of the salad in General was good. We ordered this again but made sure to ask if the crab was fresh, to which our server replied ""always"". The fishy smell was still present this time but not as bad. It's clear that the crab was canned, I don't know why they don't just acknowledge this and be honest because they are not fooling us. The men in our family are commercial fishermen in Alaska, we know what fresh crab should smell, look and taste like.We waited 30 minutes for 2 salads and a burger, no bread offered as with our previous visit. By the time the food arrived, my burger's bun was a soggy mess, which made it clear to me that our order sat there for awhile. That said, the flavor was really good. Other issue? The gorgeous house salad with the red wine vinaigrette is gone! The kicker was the servers comment as we were leaving. He went to check his tip the MINUTE we got up from the table and we heard him say ""oh really?"" In regards to his lack of tip. He couldn't be bothered with us the whole time we were there but pounced on the table immediately to find out what his tip was. Upon hearing this, I went back and let him know that if he has a issue with his tip, he should think about how he served us. This was the worst service I have ever experienced anywhere. I tweeted about it and they didn't care.That said, the flavors from everything I have tried have been solid. The ambiance is nice and inviting but the food is overpriced and lacking. We ordered a poached prawn salad with frisée and fingerling potatoes. It was more frisée than anything else, 3 tiny prawns and seriously less than one fingerling was used in this salad. Combine the overpriced food with the attitude of servers like Brad's and it's not pretty.",IjD-aHzIdFXWUGCaKCMZKw

The tools used didn't appear to be sanitized, the station itself and  surrounding areas didn't seem very clean.My gel manicure took only about 30 minutes, was very rushed and not very detailed at all.

5192,"I've been meaning to try this truck for almost a year now because I read about their Tachos, they look GOOD but sadly they are not really available at the truck all time. Their restaurant serves them though.I ordered the Poutine and Porchetta sandwich with an egg expecting something epic. It was a little disappointing. The Poutine was not what I expected, even though the fries themselves were well done. The cheese wasn't melted enough for my taste and there was very little gravy to speak of. The pork on top was good but more gravy would have made it better.As for the sandwich, I'm undecided. Each bite seemed like a mouth of full of smoke that was lacking on the savory. The pork itself was somewhat flavorless, I expected some crackle from the pork belly but found none. The sauce really seemed to overpower everything...although the egg toll coming through it was nice. This is not something I'll try again even though the sandwich itself was beautiful.I will be back for try their tacos, they look great but I'll get my Poutine fix at Skillet instead.",IjD-aHzIdFXWUGCaKCMZKw
5197,"This is an interesting little spot, it's an old house converted into a restaurant with mismatched tables, chairs and coffee mugs. The front of the house has a fireplace that would be a great area to be seated in. It has charm for sure but it is also on the small side and feels a little crowded. The menu had plenty of options for breakfast, even a build your own breakfast that seemed pretty appealing. Sometimes you want the French toast, the potatoes, the meat and all of that, you know? Settled on the Kitchen Sink scramble with toast, garlic potato cakes and a side of bacon ordered crisp.Breakfast arrived and it was a little bland. The scramble would have benefitted from some salt and pepper. The menu said the scramble included bacon, ham, pork sausage, grilled zucchini, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms and cheddar cheese. Mine was missing cheese and I had one piece of zucchini and mushroom. It was average but ingredient wise, lacking. The real disappointment was the garlic potato cakes. I expected something with more crunch, instead I got garlic mashed potatoes formed into a cake and browned. Maybe take the mashed potatoes, brown them in a pan to add some crispness then mold them into a cake and brown again? That's what I would have done. Definitely expected more than what I got. The service was somewhat attentive, I would have appreciated some water and coffee refills. The portions are good, definitely left feeling full. Considering the close quarters in each area and the average fare, there are better breakfast options in the area.",IjD-aHzIdFXWUGCaKCMZKw
5202,"The first time I was in this salon, I was impressed. I was happy with the service but I got a pedicure, this is a service most of us are probably not that critical of because we don't inspect our feet that closely. I really did like the way they present you with a drink, that sucked me in for some reason. I also really liked that they used Gehwol products, seemed like a salon that used good, quality products.I went back for a gel manicure and that's when I started noticing issues. The first problem came when I was trying to choosey colors. I went with a CND Shellac shade that was swatched on a CND marketing item, it actually said what shades were layered to create the color. When I asked for it, they wanted to charge me $5 more for using 2 shades. It's funny that they did this because they said shades 1-30 where not subject to the charge but I know for a fact that one of those shades was a layered shade. I know this because I know CND nail educators. And if you think about it, what is the deal with taking 1 coat of one shade and adding 1 coat from another on top? I decided on a different shade altogether.The manicure portion of the service was normal. All of the little scraggly bits of dry and excess skin were nipped and the massage was nice. For me, the real issues began when the polish was being applied. Gel manicures need the nails to be properly cleansed before you begin to make the polish last and avoid bubbles. This is why they dehydrate the nail before they begin. I watched as my tech apply the base coat and the polish began to bubble. I pointed this out to her and she said it would be fine. It wouldn't, this is when you remove the base coat and start over, since we hadn't cured the polish, not sure why she couldn't. As she continued, I saw lint make its way onto my nails and she basically polished right over it. After curing and applying color, the bubbles where still there. What was worse is that she shade was quite a bit sheerest than it was on their swatch. She got mad when I wanted another coat of color. This frustrated me because I couldn't understand why I was getting this attitude. I left when I was done, feeling pretty blah about the whole manicure. I didn't plan on going back.This brings me to my last experience at T2, I went back because I was in a rush and they had the time. This time I was in for a mani/pedi. My pedicure was extremely rushed and badly done, I was in and out of that chair in 15 minutes but I didn't complain because my main focus was the gel manicure. When it came time to pick my color, I picked a formula by Gel II that changes color with your body temperature. The color was a pale pink when warm and a red when cold. Again, I saw a few bubbles start to form and another piece of lint made it onto a nail. I didn't say anything, I let her work uninterrupted. As she worked, she didn't always apply the polish in strokes. She concentrated the color on the tips, at one point so much that the one nail with lint began to look like a ton of color was mounted on top of it. That area of the nail actually had a point. That was really frustrating so I finally spoke up about it but by then, she'd have to remove the color completely and start over so I let it go. Again, we ran into an opacity issue. At 3 coats, the polish just didn't look good so I asked for more. When we were done, I got into my car and noticed the color change. My issues with application aside, I was happy with the ombré look it gave me. That's when I realized there was polish cured all over my skin. I went back inside and their solution was to cut if off of my skin. I let them nip away 1 finger but it hurt like it was picked raw after awhile. They didn't want to spend the time to soak it off so I decided just to live with it. I am observant when I get a manicure, I expect to have my nails free of bubbles and lint when the tech is done. I normally don't point things out to make them feel bad while they are working or to criticize anyone. Instead, I keep it to myself and just don't go back but this salon doesn't seem interested in satisfying their customer or giving them flawless manicures. I could do my own and get the bubbles and lint all over my nails. This time I'm really not going back, which is sad because I referred people after my 1st visit and they told me their experiences where not that great.",IjD-aHzIdFXWUGCaKCMZKw
5203,"We went to Mojito's for a birthday dinner last night and we seriously regretted going there. The birthday boy chose the place based on a previous positive experience but last night's experience was not positive. We were excited since so many here gave it a good review but it was a long, drawn out experience.My first issue was with the speed of service. I ordered an appetizer (Tortilla Espanola) and it took me about 30 minutes to receive it. It was fine but it was disappointing that it took that long to get it. After that was eaten, it took maybe another 30 minutes to get our entrees. Two people in party were happy with the temperature of their food but myself and someone else, who got the same entrée, both found our entrée to be cold. Part of the dish just seemed like reheated rice and beans with tostones and the steak was an awfully tough piece of meat. It didn't feel worthy of the price they were asking for.Besides the cold food, our server just was not attentive and couldn't be bothered to even refill our water glasses or give us our check. We had to ask her for water and we had to ask for the check after waiting for maybe 20 minutes. I saw the table behind us get angry when 1 of the 4 people seated didn't get their entrée when they had been there almost as long as we had. It seemed that even the people seated outside had to come inside to get the server's attention. When we were asked how everything was, we were honest and told her we were not happy. She thanked us for ""our honesty"" and said they were open to criticism but she didn't even bother asking why we were unhappy. That spoke volumes.To add insult to injury, she made an error when running our card for payment. We gave her $40 in cash and asked that she run the balance on the card. We realized she only took $20 off the balance instead of the $40 and we brought that to her attention. Instead of voiding the transaction and starting over, she issued a refund for the $20. The result is eventually the same but it takes longer for us to get our money back through a refund.It is unfortunate that this happened, we were all excited about our meal at Mojitos given all the good reviews we've seen here. Even before we ate, the ambience and smells coming from the kitchen were all good but we won't be returning.",IjD-aHzIdFXWUGCaKCMZKw
5204,"I have wanted to stop by Rizzo's based on the reviews I saw on Yelp and the sign in their window saying they have the #1 French Dip, for a long time now. This weekend I finally saw an in for parking and decided to go in. I dream of finding a hole in the wall place that just blows me mind but this was not it. From the moment I opened up my French dip, I was disappointed. The first thing I noticed was the lack of a side of au jus for me to dip... isn't this why it's called a French DIP? Instead, the sandwich seems to be dunked in au jus and then just wrapped to hand over to the customer. If you eat this immediately, maybe it is not such a problem but I actually went home and tried to eat. By doing this, I waited much too long and my sandwich was a soggy mess. Not good.That was one issue, the other is that the sandwich just wasn't savory enough, it was a little bland. If it wasn't for the cheese on my soggy sandwich, I would have been left with what tasted like boiled meat and soggy bread. The au jus helped a tiny bit but otherwise it lacked the oomph that I usually associate with an au jus. A little more salt would have gone a long way. Overall, my experience at Rizzo's was pretty ordinary and forgettable, I won't be stopping by again. Frankly, I'm starting to wonder if the people who rated this place so well know what a real French dip tastes like.",IjD-aHzIdFXWUGCaKCMZKw
5205,"I went to Calidora today for laser hair removal treatment and ended up leaving minutes after being seated in the treatment room. My review is based on their customer service alone, not any treatments I received... I never got that far! :(This started with a 1-hour appointment for a skin analysis. I was under the impression this was somehow related to the laser hair removal treatments I was there for but this was really only an attempt to gain information to sell me other services. While it was a waste of my time and had nothing to do with what I was there for, it was interesting to learn more about my skin.During this 1-hour appointment, I had to fill out forms that included my medical information. I didn't think this information would later serve as a reason to delay the treatment I wanted. This information was available to Calidora for over 1 week and they never acted on it until I was in the clinic for my appointment.When I sat down with the doctor, who I thought was going to perform my treatment, she questioned items on my medical history I supplied them with earlier and proceeded to tell me she was not going to give me the treatment without a doctor's letter. Even when she was doing this, she didn't bother giving me the courtesy of being direct enough to tell me the treatment wasn't happening today. To make matters worse, they had me drive in to their clinic to be told this, they had no consideration for my time whatsoever. I even left work early to make it in time for this appointment. No one even bothered to apologize for this for until I went back into the office to let them know that what they did was not cool. No one bothered to explain why the treatment was supposedly so risky they needed my doctor's consent and no one offered to rebook the appointment allowing the time to get this letter they supposedly wanted. When you add this disregard for patient time to the doctor's unpleasant demeanor, this makes Calidora U Village a clinic I will not go to ever again. I hear other locations are better but I'd steer clear of this one.",IjD-aHzIdFXWUGCaKCMZKw
5206,"I needed to get a manicure and pedicure before my trip and saw a place by the mall that I thought would be convenient. It's always busy so that seemed like a good sign to me... not really.I was really disappointed with the service I received. I had my pedicure first and she performed the basics, cutting nails, filing and a quick massage of my legs with some lotion but it was all quick that it all felt useless. I could have given myself a better ""spa"" pedicure at home. I was expecting a little bit more attention to my heels than I received but I didn't feel like calling any more attention to myself in a salon where EVERYONE stares at you. It made me feel very uncomfortable.Then came my manicure. I'm not sure what kind of base coat and top coat was used but my nail polish came peeling off by day 3 of my manicure. I know my polish was good, I brought it in myself. To top it off, my nails were filed in an odd shape. I'm not sure why she couldn't tell that they were not even. Again, instead of calling attention to myself, I opted to fix it myself at home.  Crooked nails + peeling polish = bad manicure.The one good note about the experience is that they listened to me. I have a nail that is very sensitive to touch and it can be very painful if it's handled the wrong way. I told the manicurist to be careful with that finger and she definitely was, so careful that I had to tell her it was ok to use a tiny bit more pressure.Besides that one tiny positive aspect of this salon, I'd avoid it if I were you.",IjD-aHzIdFXWUGCaKCMZKw

5223,"Location: Upstairs on the second floor. Service: I went here in February and had a good time in the lounge but my recent visit made me think otherwise. The service was okay, not great, but not bad either. I called in for a reservation a day earlier and they told me I'll be in Room 4 which will also be under my name. My friend came earlier and tried to find Room 4, but there wasn't any Room 4 and instead, it was moved to Room 8 under the name ""Kristine"". When I arrived there, we went to Room 8 and then we got settled. It was already 15 minutes into our room time and they brought up the room problem again as we were trying to sing. We told them what was told to us and they had to verify with another staff before asking what was the phone number I reserved the room under. Eventually that was cleared and then we ended up having a server that seemed to be very moody. We were also told that the room we got was a medium instead of the small so apparently we got upgraded unknowingly? She checked all of our id's which was cool since we were drinking. Then, when my friend brought out her hydroflask, the server flipped out and confiscated it immediately. They have a policy where in order to split the bill, they need to hold onto someone's credit card which is super weird instead of waiting at the end. When we ordered drinks, our server got impatient with us and told us, ""If you don't order now, I'll go and come back because I have other people waiting on me"". They also charge an automatic gratitiuty for a party of 6 or more on top of the room charge. You are also required to purchase one drink per person in the room which ends up being really pricey. Song choices: They play the music videos for the actual songs, but their song selection isn't that great. They don't have many of the popular songs and some of the songs are really hard to find. For instance, to find ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" you have to find the artist name first instead of searching by the song title. Drinks: The rainbow shot drinks ($36) was really good, you can't taste the alcohol and it looks so pretty! The Midori Medley ($7; $5 Happy Hour) tasted like a combination of midori with fruit juice and sprite, it tasted really good. Overall: I was really disappointed by my recent visit to Air Park and don't think I'll be coming again. I wish the service and the way they ran their business was better. I love the drinks, but all these rules and regulations really put a dampen on how I felt as a customer. My word of advice to the business owner and staff is to mention all what they expect to the customers beforehand either by phone or verbal communication. Also better training on customer service should be made in order to keep your customers happy. I was reading other recent reviews and notice a reoccurring theme of disappointment. If someone does make a reservation, don't give them wrong information and verify with them before making them wait or waste their time in the room trying to handle the dispute. If you do make a mistake, make up for it in the time that was wasted trying to handle the dispute.",aWejHqThyw_ODaEMB4TdWA

The advertised peanut sauce had no texture and did not contain peanuts or peanut butter to add that depth of flavor or texture to it. I would say they added more vinegar than actually peanut butter or crushed peanuts to enhance the flavor or texture. The summer roll itself was a disappointment and did not contain much filling for $6. I would describe it as rice paper with cucumbers, carrots, rice noodles, a lot of lettuce, and 2 shrimps cut in half and wrapped tightly. I would not come again for it, I left feeling sick and sad.

They were extremely bummed out on the bad service because usually the food and service are good, but that day when we went, it was just terrible. We got the Li Hi Mui Margarita pitcher and it tasted like an entire packet of li hi mui  powder was put in it. It was extremely hard to drink it because the li hi mui taste was just too overwhelming. I'm not really into Mexican food since I can't eat tomatoes and fried food, but found their chicken and spinach quesadilla really yummy. I was somewhat disappointed that they did not put the spinach in and my boyfriend had to ask them why there was no spinach in the quesadilla upon getting the food, but they came back with the spinach and we had to manually put inside it. I was reluctant to try the rice, salad, and meat on the plate too because I can't eat tomatoes, but found the rice good. The service was not good. We were waiting for the check to come for 30 minutes after being finished with eating and had to ask the waiter for our check.

5394,"I got the brown rice and salmon bento for $6.49 or so. I was unimpressed by the dish because of how overcooked and dry some pieces of the salmon were. The salmon was bland, and had just a hint of salt, which resulted in little flavor. Some parts of the salmon were overcooked to the point that I deduced they never watched how long the salmon was being baked, pan-fried, or cooked because all of the fatty and natural oils were removed. There was one salmon piece that wasn't overcooked, but still lacked flavor. The salmon to rice ratio seemed fair, but the brown rice was just bland. There was no flavor or toppings to help the dish stand out. The broccoli which was placed on the side was raw and slightly cooked. The side of spinach sauteed in sesame oil was okay, but tasted predominantly like sesame oil. I gave a low rating to Aja Sushi and Bento to the unsanitary find of a white thin piece of plastic found in my dish.

She seemed irritated that I was asking for it and hesitantly offered to go look for one in the back for me. She was rude and abrupt when she asked what size/color I wanted. When she came back she was empty handed and told me to order it online. What a waste of my time to come in the store.

Apparently it's the same price whether you receive the shampoo or not. Just a mere 7 minutes later she was done and my hair looked exactly the same. No styling products and no dry. I left with my hair damp. I'm so disappointed. I didn't expect much for a hair salon in a strip mall but it would've been a lot better if she actually took the time to cut layers in my hair to take the bulk out like I asked.

Over the years and many visits later the service has really gone down hill. I'm not sure why they don't staff better on peak nights but there are never more than 2 waiters and one food runner.  The only really warm waiter was Lani who is no longer there. There is a waiter that is so rushed he just runs around the room grabbing this and that and talking to two tables at once. All that jumping around is a real mood killer and it doesn't equate into him being accurate or thorough.   Water refills can be hard to come by. My daughter usually has to drink from ours too.The food seems rushed and the flavors of the island fusion don't always mesh well.  The menu has not changed at all since our first visit. The specials rotate so they are never really new either. There's a soup (runs out early), a beef and fish preparation. Weekends is also a prime rib special.Our last visit we ordered 2 glasses of house wine. We were served our entrees first, then the appetizer, still no wine. I don't think he even put it in with the bar. On another visit we sat at the bar only to find out the bar keeper could only pour from the list of house mixed drinks. No other mixed drinks. I don't think she had any experience at all. The live music is usually very good but it's hard to hear over so much loud conversation in the small dining room. Seating is also on the front patio (just hope theres no rain or loud cars speeding past), a ground level patio along the building facing the parking lot and a side extension area that is lesser decorated than the main room.  Kind of feels like you're second class diners in there. It is also pricey. Dinner for three can exceed $100.  The owners had a good thing going years ago and they definitely have the market as the only clean eat in restaurant in lower Puna but I do not recommend Kaleo's as your best bet.  Enjoy a cruise into Hilo for quality dishes, reasonable prices & better service.",Ry_LUa1dtfuuEW_zQ1jm2Q

Then she will discreetly take what she wants & issue you a receipt, handing back what's rejected. Be prepared to wait a long time to receive the unsold items back. We called numerous times kept stopping in but she would always say she's too busy to inventory her shop and we would have to sort thru her store to look for our clothes ourselves. That defeated the point of splitting the sale 50/50 as I would be doing her job.  Six months passed before she finally had our unsold items and the last of our cash ready. The shop is unorganized, clothing is overpriced considering its very worn condition and we didn't get back our things in the 3 month turnaround as she told us. Only consign here if you don't need the money right away & if you're looking for a hassle. You're better off selling your stuff yourself & taking the entire profit.",Ry_LUa1dtfuuEW_zQ1jm2Q

5541,"Keeps getting worse and worse. Others have it right that this is one of the worst branches in the group. In our last meal, the dumplings were very gamey tasting and the pork did not taste good. Also very oily.  Then, today after a takeout order for 4, they are so cheap now that they will only give dipping sauces for 2 as a new policy, charging for any beyond 2 regardless of the number of people eating. We ordered 7 items but could only get dipping sauce for 2. How cheap and stupid. No customer service there. Our to go order of cucumber salad only had a few small thin slices, barely filling 1/3 of the small container, and just seemed extremely small compared to what we remember as usual. Other portions seemed ok, but the potstickers were overwhelmingly salty and we could not get the taste out of our mouths for quite a while. Not sure what happened. The chicken noodles were also so oily today and you could see so much  oil separated from the sauce in the bottom of the box. They keep destroying their brand by declining food and service while the prices go up and up. We keep going less and less. Very sad.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5542,"Dropping 2 stars for 2 poor experiences on the last visit, which may be our last visit for a while. The linguine ""vongole"" was seriously substandard using either canned or frozen chopped clams opposed to fresh clams, preferably in the shell.  This is a city blessed with lovely reasonable cost fresh shellfish, so I am baffled that they serve such low quality chopped clams that are so poor tasting.  Also, the portion size was small and equally disappointing. The sauce was equally bad. It was one of the worst clams with linguine we have tried in Seattle in quite a while, and a terrible value for the price. Avoid that at all costs, but it is also is a bad sign that they will take shortcuts like this.  On a cold night, it is very disappointing when they don't open on time, and shuffle late unprepared to open the doors, especially when customers have to queue up upside and compete for a table, because they won't offer reservations, as another establishment contributing to the poorest customer service practices in Seattle. As the night progresses, it is surprising that people are willing to wait so long to eat here in the very crowded front room. It is just not good enough for that. We were the second customers admitted after arriving early and being part of a long line, but one of the last to have our order taken.  That system sucks, although I still like their bread which they only give you one portion of. On the positive side, after the slow start, the service was spot on for the rest of the meal. On another down side, some dishes seems to include very fatty oils, or something else low end like that, that made me feel quite uncomfortable and regretting eating there at the end of the meal. They need to use more higher quality olive oils in the cooking.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

It's not even 9:00 AM yet on Saturday, and they are already out of egg bagels, one of the main reasons I go to this business and not the competition. We also didn't get what we ordered today and were overcharged as a result. The service and operations at this branch are continuously so poor. I don't see any customer service mindset.  It is like dawn of the dead each time, and sooo slow. I am not surprised to read other reviews of people waiting extremely long durations of time for a simple bagel. I agree with another review that bagels dont always seem toasted when ordered that way.  I really like the product when it is made right, and I want this business to do very well on the West side,  but they have to hire and train competent managers, better staff, get professional, and act like a real business. Why is this branch consistently a joke? Customers are not first here, as my previous reviews also reflect. It is always so frustrating. They make it so hard to be their customer, and I definitley go much less often than before because of their terrible performance across multiple visits. It is also obvious over time that the business does not learn from Yelp reviews, and does not take any appropriate actions to acknowledge their issues and improve. What kind of business is this?",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5550,"Although the service was very good and the atmosphere was fine, I found the food quite disappointing, and not even close to living up to the high Yelp ratings. I was happy they had bulgar in addition to rice, yet the bulgar flavor was pretty bland. The bigger issue was that my $20 chicken kabob was undercooked and too pink on the inside. Meanwhile, the bread did not remind me of any of the many great Turkish breads I have had in the past, but more like a white bleached flour type dinner roll at the supermarket. The lamb was very gamey in flavor and not too enjoyable. The shepards salad was Ok but not really anything special. Also the shrimp appetizer was a disappointment with hardly any shrimp in there, and the shrimp present were still too small. The biggest disappointment was being told their policy is to charge $1.50 for every refill of the small Turkish tea glass. I have never seen that before in any Turkish restaurant anywhere in the country or even the world. In fact it can often be offered complimentary as Turkish hospitality. If this is what 4.5 stars looks like in Olympia, I am going to just do a drive through next time. We ordered a lot, but our party of 4 were not very impressed by anything served.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5555,"They are no longer making matcha donuts, and those were the main reason I came here. Their passion fruit donuts which sounded so good were unfortunately also a big disappointment. They tasted too artificial and rich, departing too far from the flavor of the wonderful fruit. However, the orange olive oil and Mexican chocolate donuts were pretty good. Deliberately making customers wait in a long slow moving single file line in a packed venue with only one person taking orders during peak donut hours absolutely sucks. Not a fan to wait in a crowded line 30 minutes to pay close to 50 bucks for coffees and donuts for 4 people, including tip.  Ok, but not good enough donuts to justify that. Feels like a lot of marketing hype here and not the charm and magic I expected. Maybe they got big too fast, as they seem to have several locations now. I wonder if they all this disappointing.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5556,"This time it was more like descend. Or possibly an outright free fall. The visit was substandard right from the start, as the pre-dining lounge experience was pretty poor and low class. It is too crowded and unpleasant there now. Masses of people flock to visit and the lounge is just not able to keep up. It is totally chaotic and feels like a tourist trap. We weren't able to get an adult drink served in almost 30 minutes of attempting it, after checking in and before sitting down for our dinner reservation. They just don't take care of their dining customers in the lounge. After a longgggg wait, we did get the 3 waters we asked for in the lounge before going to the table, but without the ice we requested, and they only served 2 cocktail napkins vs. 3 and never brought the third one they said they would correct. The glasses were wet on the outside from a botched pour or spill, which made them unpleasant to drink. I was also not impressed by the smudged or dirty streaked looking southern windows at sunset time in the lounge area. The cocktails never arrived, and we had to ask multiple times even after being seated  for dinner to bring them to our table. The hostess that sat us was hardly audible to the whole party, mumbling, when giving us the initial tour of the grill area before being seated. That experience was totally pointless and not professional. The food at dinner was also generally disappointing for the very high price points. Most sushi was Ok, but nothing wowed, and their Uni was really bad compared to several others I have had within the last week or two from various origins. It is ridiculous to serve that bottom level uni for $9  per piece of nigiri. They are just not using a good quality product, and should not serve anything if they are not capable of procuring better. Unfortunately, the highest priced item of the meal, which was their top grade of Japanese A5 Wagyu beef filet, just wasn't cooked very well. It didn't taste balanced, and was perhaps way too overcooked and ruined on the outside. Also, the beef did not taste anything like the last visit, totally missing that buttery texture and flavor. It tasted kind of harsh down at a level more like something at a 70% lower price point. I wondered if they even served what we paid for, or slipped us a lower grade and cheated us. It was an utter disappointment paying several hundreds of $s for the beef alone. Two members of the party did not even want to finish their beef, so I ate it to avoid waste. I also felt like I overdosed on sodium from that meal. Way too much salt, but still not able to hide poor quality product and/or preparation. Overall, the food was 2-2.5 stars in several cases, especially given the price point. However their bread tray and potatoes were pretty awesome, so at least they got that right. Other seafood, sushi, and beef was just so-so at best. Our service was much better than the food with mostly 5 star service by the dinner team, with the big exception of nothing done after the feedback to the sever about the beef not pleasing us.  They also ran out of their top dessert which was a bummer. They first tried to seat us in a booth with a horrible view, even after reserving many days in advance, and asking for a nice table. Then, they moved us to another booth that was a little better, but still small and not too comfortable for 3 people. It looked to they balcony to the South that was unsightly with outdoor furniture sloppily stored out of season in disarray around the deck.  Beverages were good, but unfortunately the food was just not as good this time. They even ran out of their top dessert and could not serve it. It also sucks that I can never reach a human when I call there. I always go straight to voicemail when I call and try to reach a human. The extra back of the house service fee added to the check is also a total joke to introduce to Seattle especially when the food isn'teven prepared properly.  Won't be back anytime soon. This was not proper fine dining, and it surely did not justify the cost. It is more like a bad Vegas tourist trap dining experience.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5557,"$4 for a small simple premade, prefrozen popsicle that is served as is, simply wrapped, right out of the freezer case. They were also far too watery. What comes next? Maybe a business that sells $5 single sticks of gum? The flavor options are well planned, and quite diverse. Great idea to serve Spicy Mexican Chocolate, Guava, Matcha, and Coconut flavors. However they are all still just popsicles. The idea idea to charge $4 for a popsicle and even an additional add on cost to dip it is a marketing disaster that ruins what could have been a good offering. I laughed at how stupid I thought I was to be there, where a simple street type product is being sold for $4 or more per piece. The atmosphere and service were decent, but nothing so special on that front either. Parking is also pretty difficult here. I might have enjoyed the experience enough to return if the popsicles were $3 or less.  I can buy a whole box that I would enjoy just as much at the store, and those may even look nicer coming out of the box and the package, and are so much better value, than buying 1 or 2 pieces here. At least at the expensive ice cream shops around town you get samples first, and your scoops are hand dipped to better justify the prices. This just seems ridiculous to me.  I will definitely go to our great small batch ice cream shops instead for a much better value and better tasting dessert experience, that is so much more enjoyable to eat. I have seen the same concept as this place done in other US cities at much much better value, for what was being served. Not sure what happened here.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

Definitely not worth waiting in any lines for these days, and definitely not what it used to be. On the last visit, most ices were too melted, mostly liquid, and the flavor just wasn't there. I had to do the unthinkable and drop several watery cups of flavorless ice in the trash, as there was no enjoyment factor. Disappointing to see the quality has dropped so low.  That poor quality means my friends and I won't return in future seasons, and won't recommend this Chicago institution anymore either. If they keep heading in this direction, lines will be a non issue in the future. I guess good things do not last forever.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5570,"This is just not a very professional or customer centric business. First of all, they don't take the time to reply to customer feedback in Yelp reviews.  Their better local competition keeps their web sites updated with rotating monthly flavors so customers know exactly what to expect on a particular day or month. They do not share the rotating or seasonal  flavors they have at any moment on the web, but rather share what they MAY have seasonally and it is not clear what flavors come in what seasons. Therefore, the customer has no idea what they are really serving at the shop. and it sets the customer up for disappointment when the flavors they really want are not available. My recent experiences are bad because the shop lost credibility by not serving their best matcha green tea flavors anymore. After breaking many promises to bring them back in days or weeks, the flavors didn't come back. Then, they recently said to me they aren't going to bring green tea flavors back at all, because Katsu burger is serving green tea milkshakes.  Are you kidding me? Maybe they should turn their entire space over to Katsu burger? Those flavors were the #1 reason several of my friends and I drove to Ballard to go to this shop.  I'd like to see more delivery of what customers want than acting like a wimpy business. Ok fine, I have a Katsu burger near my house and don't even need to go to Ballard at all then if that is where you recommend I go for green tea ice cream. Again, several of my friends also loved the matcha, and blueberry matcha flavors here,  and we are all disappointed the staff kept saying it was coming back soon, yet it never showed up. They seriously lost a lot of business they would have had to several of their small batch ice cream competitors in the Central and U district, as well as Capitol Hill. That also helps us avoid the parking nightmare around this shop.  Those places are much more accessible for non Ballard residents. This place needs to learn that if want more business they need to meet their promises,  be competitive, do more, and try harder to meet customer needs, not do less.  Unimpressed by the way they ignore the voice of the customer in the shop, by phone, and on Yelp. 3 strikes folks.  Maybe they are just too cheap to make a good quality matcha flavor now because the margins are lower? Hello, Asian flavors are hot and now you are not. You get the big gong.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5574,"The beef is excellent, the Italian ice is decent too, and it is nice that they finally take credit cards. I stopped in for an afternoon snack after lunch and my only big disappointment was the Customer Service. The manager refused to cut a sandwich in half and put it in two wrappings in two bags so my friend and I could take it to go, and easily share it in the car without making a mess. Not only did they refuse to do that, but they didn't even fully cut the sandwich in half, and we had to tear it apart with our hands. As a result, it dripped all over the place when we tried to share and eat it. Funny, as when we were in the mood for beef 3 days later, we went to one of the competition just because of that one poor decision the manager made. It's great food and mostly decent customer service there,  but the manager has a bit of a service mindset issue not putting customers first, and not willing to do something so small that makes a huge difference for the customer.  That's a huge miss in the very competitive Italian Beef market in Chicago.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5576,"This restaurant is smaller than other outposts, but pleasant in atmosphere. Service attitude was excellent too.  Some food was close to the higher level I would expect, but there were several disappointments that made it more of a 2-3 star mixed food experience, considering the high price point.  First, they have replaced the traditional excellent breads that have been a formula for success for years and replaced them with pretty boring tasteless rolls.  A big downgrade and mistake. They also do not seem to serve the pickle tray any more, and only brought some cucumber pickels after I asked for them later in the meal service. The lobster was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious, but they did not leave a lobster cracker on the table to fine tune the cracking, after they cracked most of the larger pieces.  Not a huge issue, but a detail worth getting right. Also with two people at the table, they only served one small seafood fork with the lobster. Not tragic, but again a detail I would like to see them get right.I often go mostly for the Italian items that I love, but those items were unfortunately mediocre and more of a disappointment this time, compared to the better prepared dishes. It was edible, but there was no WOW like the good old days at the Palm. The Chicken Parmigiana was correctly served thin as I like it, but the chicken was a bit too soft and far too chewy, and missing a badly needed slightly crispy texture. Also the sauce and cheese was not evenly distributed on the plate. The side of pasta was an even bigger disappointment, as the dish arrived with the sauce already set and hardened a bit on the top. I assume they either microwaved it, left it sitting under a lamp far too long, or baked it, ... all unacceptable. The marinara sauce on the pasta seemed boring, simple, and lacking flavor, regardless of the texture. It used to be so much more flavorful. I really don't understand why it is different now. I also did not like how they demoted the super star clams oregenata off the menu and replaced it with a much less enjoyable clams casino that we ordered by accident. We took the clams casino anyway, but they were not very good. We then ordered the clams oreganata next, and they were perfectly delicious.The salads with Russian dressing and desserts were amazing as I would have hoped. However, the restaurant is starting to marginalize some of the great traditions that made this brand what it is. Changing the menu, and serving poorly prepared food in some cases is inexcusable at this price point. I picked this chain over some great local Italian restaurants (i.e. Taylor Street) expecting the traditional Palm Quality level, yet it did not deliver in multiple aspects. It is similar to my experiences recently in Boston, DC, and Charlotte. Sometimes it is very good, but sometimes it just isn't. It's the LA branches that seem to get it right consistently, especially in Beverly Hills. The food is just not consistent in other eastern and midwest branches, and the ""chain"" is not properly managing and maintaining a top level of quality at all locations.  They better turn the ship quickly or they are heading to a path of permanent reputational damage that they will not be able to recover from. Come on guys. Management and the chefs need to step up far better than current state. I love this restaurant when it is at it's best, and I am in their frequent diner club,  but if they don't get it together I wont be able to keep returning, as it is a waste of time and money. They're not protecting their traditions that made them great once upon a time. The only cartoon image of me I can imagine on their wall now, is me running to the door to go to another restaurant that keeps it real, doesn't take short cuts, and pays better attention to what they are doing.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5581,"Being a customer here feels like booking a theme park tourist trap experience, completely void of any class, hospitality, service, or human touch. Doesn't resemble a Michelin star experience, and doesn't deserve any stars anymore. Actually, I would rather deal with a theme park customer service center and eat at one of their buffets of marginal processed food, than deal with the crappy customer experience here that is a no starter right from the beginning. Big downgrade for Alinea. Michelin stars not deserved. Repeat customers are forced to impersonal online reservations, they don't answer their phone number for questions or take voice messages whenever I call, but they force you by a silly recorded message to the web whether you like it or not. After being on a waiting list for many days for a table to probably overpay for what was special and innovative 5-6 years ago, you get misled by an email that says reservations available, and fine print that a slot may be open that day, but then you are forced into another longshot online competition that you will likely waste your time on, and lose, if you have the same experience as me. They must make multiple wait list customers compete for open slots, so it almost seems like the wait list means nothing. What a poorly designed system. Zero respect and no consideration for their customers. Forget Alinea. Jacked up prices to the max, everything designed for the convenience of the business, and totally missing basic customer service standards. They seem in a big hurry to profit and take your money without care, living off the former glory of achieving Michelin stars they really don't deserve now. It is more like hearding animals than running a classy restaurant. Zero Stars. A sellout and discrace to Chicago now. I hope and encourage their stars to go away. If you want to go and spend hundreds if not thousands of $ on a dinner where you are not even treated with respect as a customer, be my guest.

Don't expect a seat, because you just may not get one with the mass of humanity in there. They also could really use a urinal in the men's room and clean the bathroom more often. They also need autoflushing toilets badly. Just believe me when I say this. Also beware of the pools of urine all over the floor.The adult beverages are average at best, and pretty simple and uninspired in terms of the offerings. It is also annoying that complimentary water is often served only in cheap plastic cups, in what is supposed to be a premium lounge. Lazy and cheap!The food is just Ok your first visit, and then it tends to repetitively suck more and more each time you return. With the exception of minor variations like fatty pork belly one time and nice chicken breast another time, everything else is basically the same boring crap, same cheese, same vegetables, same dates, same this, same that, and basically just an odd layout of food. Not really enjoyable food, not filling in a good way with any substance, and it definitely doesn't come across high end at all. They never tend to, or replenish the troughs of food that look like a heard of animals have been through there not long after the lounge opens. This mess is just sadly ignored and abandoned after service starts, and the crowds attack the food in feeding frenzy. The food is also an unappealing tribute to Tom Douglas who is so shamelessly promoted with his giant unappetizing poster picture hanging over the food. A lot of ego there, but not much pride. It should be a poster of him turning around in shame at the ugly picked over, unattended, repetitive, boring food ""presented"" underneath him with cheap paper plates, small paper cocktail napkins with sponsor advertising, and plastic forks. Then at intermission, they serve chocolates that never get replenished, even if some of their guests dont even get any.They really are missing the boat in terms of keeping it classy. If you're going to do a private lounge, do it right or don't even bother. I often don't even want to visit this place, and prefer to just go straight to my seats. I also don't feel any inspiration to patronize any of the sponsors, as if this is the best they can do advertising their brand around a shrine to mediocracy with half hearted sponsorship and poor quality of delivery, then no thanks.  Wish I could give a better review, but I just can't.  They need to step it up in this lounge big time. It is more like a car dealer service department customer lounge, yet I have been to several of those that still are better than this place.  By the way, the hostesses at the front of the lounge are very, very nice, and they do deserve 5 stars for kindness and good service.

The fried cod is just boring, the clam strips were as greasy as can be, and the fried shrimp were also greasy, and they looked and tasted horrible. Their cocktail sauce sucks too with no body or taste. I suspect they also use that cheap corn syrup sweetener that is on the lable of the Ivars cocktail sauce sold at whole foods.  I tried that once too, and it immediately went on an express trip to the garbage can. Compared to any good cocktail sauce, especially a classic one, I give them an F for failure. It is just as bad in the restaurant as it is from the store. The Dungeness crab bisque bit the big one too and was hardened and congealed on the top. There was a lot of creme and very little crab.  What a joke. Instead of keeping top quality ingredients and representing this region like a fine institution, they go the cheap low effort sell out route. Their kitchen should be ashamed. On the other hand, they did have nice nice freshly brewed iced tea, great servers, and good rolls, so I wont go lower than 2 stars, but that still can't undue the many total failures coming out of the kitchen.

Sometimes the meat filling seems better quality than others, and unfortunately, the overall quality and taste seems to be slipping recently.What is totally unacceptable is that the restaurant from the front door to the fake bamboo plants to the bathroom is almost always dirty and unsightly to some extent. They don't properly care for or upkeep the cleanliness of the restaurant. It is also equally unacceptable that their food safety rating in the window last time I visited says ""Needs to Improve"" which is the absolute lowest rating possible. I can only imagine what earned that poor rating. That is a key reason I have no interest to return to this restaurant anytime soon.Other disappointments are poorly prepared main dishes that can contain large lumps of sugar or poor balance between meat and vegetables, with some dishes having too much of what seems like canned vegetables.Spring rolls are sometimes very tasty and other times totally grease logged and basically inedible. Service is highly variable and sporadic from good to poor depending on the visit.  Maybe the best way to describe the restaurant overall is unprofessional, inconsistent, and unreliable.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5603,"Lackluster average at best Mexican food. Everything tried has been been edible, but not very flavorful or impressive. Maybe what you would expect in a shopping mall, or perhaps not even that good.  Location is their best attribute if you need to eat around Pacific Place, as it is usually no problem finding an open table here. The downside is that there is a reason they don't get long lines.  Service is good, but one thing really bothered me recently, coming across very greedy and cheap. We ordered a very minature piece of tres leche cake to go, and it came to nearly 10 dollars including an added ""to go charge"" for one small brown paper napkin wrapped around plastic utensils. As if residents and visitors in Seattle do not get taxed and exploited enough when dining out...This business finds a new way to get some extra money out of you. The cake was also the most overpriced miniscule piece of tres leche cake I have ever seen. It was the size of a mini cup cake. How unbelievably greedy to serve that, at that price point, and to add the ""to go charge"". Not how you stay in business trying to gouge your customers out of every penny possible to increase your margin, while you offer a sub par product.  It is a bad business practice, kind of like how many Seattle restaurants charge for white rice with Chinese or Thai food, chips and salsa at a Mexican Restaurant, or bread and butter in a steak house or local style restaurant.  This place actually still offers free chips and salsa so they do deserve a pat on the back for getting that right.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5604,"The customer service at this restaurant starting from the moment you walk in the front door is a total disappointment. This place always feels like a has been tourist trap that tries to feed off of hotel business without even extending the bare minimum effort. I agree with another recent Yelp reviewer that the hostess is quite rude and careless with guests. The food is hit or miss depending on the dish and day you go. There are definitely several better options in this city. I tried to go back again tonight, after very mediocre dim sum last time, and the service was so poor and frustrating before I could even order, that we all decided to go to another restaurant instead.  It was a great move as we saved the night with a wonderful meal compared to being a victim at this disappointing restaurant.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5621,"It is a good traditional throw back option if you are craving fast food, but the overall company seems poorly managed. I see declining Quality and Customer Service in most of my recent visits across the country. Seattle's branch can be problematic as the location is not such a nice street to walk on, and the prices at this Steak N Shake make it a questionable value for what you get. Seems like you are better upgrading to a nicer place or going with the local hamburger chain in Seattle that delivers a pretty good quality product at a more reasonable price. I probably do not need to mention their name, but it starts with the letter D. Getting this stuff delivered could be interesting, but they do not use Amazon restaurants, which is what I and many in Seattle rely on for delivery service. In fact, many people in Seattle work for Amazon so choosing other delivery services in town is a marketing miss.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5623,"I strongly recommend you don't go here, as this is another one of those posing baloney Seattle restaurants that totally over charges, under delivers, and doesn't seem to think much of, or care about their customers at all. This is a very pretentious and unprofessional restaurant. A total joke, and not well managed for our experience. I spent $170+ for 2 adults and a child, and although some food was decent,  we were served rotten sole fish for the main course that they attempted to drown in salt. Totally amature cooking. The taste was hidious. Then, no server or staff even checked on us or how the food was, until way after the other main dishes were completely eaten by the rest of the table. We were totally ignored after the runner delivered our food on top of the previous pasta course we were just finishing, and they didn't clear one of the empty pasta plates for the entire duration of the main course either. That also left no opportunity to correct the inedible spoiled fish meal before everyone else at the table was finished. When I finally got the opportunity to send back the fish dish, and I gave my feedback, they removed the fish I didn't eat from my bill and said the chef acknowledged the fish was bad.  However, they did not attempt and were not willing to do or offer ANY other concession or adjustment to the bill as good will after they totally failed on both food and service and ruined our overall meal. They only wanted to still squeeze every penny out of me, not recognizing I told them I live here, and not realizing I could be a frequent customer if they were capable of delivering any resemblance of quality or recovery for their failures. They seem totally complacent and entitled there which is a mistake.  I told the manager this all really bothered me and that I would give a 1 star review on Yelp, and the manager's arrogant, cheap, and short sighted reply was just thank you for your feedback. Ok, you want to ruin my meal and have alligator arms when it comes to trying to make it right. You not only blew it the first time  but you wasted an opportunity to turn it around. Fine. I won't be back, nor will I bring anyone I know, nor can I advocate anything positive about this restaurant.At the meal I was told they do no substitutions, and when I mentioned I called in and asked for a sauce some day omitting an ingredient I am allergic to, they said they could do it with a couple of days notice. When I told the sever that to confirm for next time, she said it needs to be a week in advance. That is so ridiculous.I wanted to add that a very limited portion of the staff had really nice personality and attitude, but the lady manager and hostess came across so poorly to us. Such a mistake to staff a restaurant like that with people that don't seem very concerned with customers and are lacking service skill and a real service oriented mindset. It represents Seattle very poorly. The hostess cast kind of a negative cloud over us almost feeling like we were being judged on entry, although she was better later. It is always great to pay top dollar and get treated with such a lack of warmth by some of the staff members.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5625,"The location is cool with potential, and the servers and sushi chefs are nice, but the sushi is not very presentable in the case or on the plate. Unfortunately, the taste was not good or satisfying either. We will never leave behind good sushi, but we wasted a lot of the fish, as it was just gross compared to what we are used to being served in better sushi restaurants. Some items were mediocre and some were just bad. Nothing was wow, and overall quality was low. They seem to go for quantity over quality, which is not a good approach with sushi. To their credit, they refunded one nigiri course which was horrible, hence a 2 star rating instead of 1. It never feels good to spend $70 for lunch and to not enjoy it, and actually waste and leave behind much of your meal. It is even worst to leave hungry because you are too turned off to finish what they served. Even the wasbsi come across as a very cheap one compared to much better offerings around town. The gyoza also tasted very bland and after we each took a bite of one, we wasted the entire order as it was pretty much flavorless or just blah, and it was pretty expensive too. The miso soup and salad were the only items I was able to eat without being gravely disappointed, but there was nothing fabulous going on with those either...",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

5628,"Minus a star for serving grisly dark meat chicken in the noodle bowl at brunch Sunday, and no longer serving the nicer lemongrass white meat chicken breast which was actually good. Not very impressed that I paid around $70 for brunch for 2 without any adult beverages and the food wasn't impressive. The meat seemed like a loser from the fourth race at Emerald Downs, noodles and dumplings were especially starchy, the crepe was starchy, watery, and oily, and it was a big disappointment to be told to fill out a comment card on my feedback, and there still has been no follow up coming on the fourth day since my visit...  close to dropping to one star. The kitchen is too inconsistent and the restaurant can not maintain success trying to run on autopilot without proper care, passion, and attention. On the other hand, the Pho was good even if such a small bowl, and the service and atmosphere were still impressive. However one of the unisex bathrooms was a bit dumpy. On their way to mediocrity without some serious changes, especially in the kitchen.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5637,"A restaurant that had signs of great potential seems to have given up and lost its way, resulting in a mediocre dining experience. It is unfortunately no longer worth my effort to run the gauntlet of numerous aggressive pan handlers that stalk the street in front of the restaurant.Update for my latest lunch experience on top of my previous dinner focused review:The service was really strong compared to earlier visits, but the Thali lunch was so underwhelming and boring. It was semi edible, but the portion of everything including the naan was very small and the food just did not have any wow factor to it. Also, not all dishes were severed at consistent hot temperatures, with some only being luke warm at best. I left feeling rather blah.  For a $16 a person lunch before drinks, tax, and tip, it was not satisfying at all, not enjoyable, and not worth going back for.Previous dinners: food and flavors are sometimes quite satisfying for several dishes, but not all dishes are equally good, and it is extremely difficult to get special requests accommodated. The service can be painfully slow at times, and they seem to only seldomly answer their phones.  The restaurant needs better professional management engaged in the day to day operations, and to be a bit more customer focused.  Prices are on the high end for Seattle Indian food, but the gaps in customer focus and the inconsistency of the food quality doesn't justify the price. The building and atmosphere are really nice, but without other aspects of the restaurant at the same level, it just doesn't matter.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5640,"The place is cute, but it was not as ""tasty"" as I had hoped, and it unfortunately did not live up to its name, or some of the Yelp pictures that attracted me to go there.  Potstickers were big and very doughy, and even burnt during the pan frying stage. The filling was not too tasty either, so at $7.95, they were a big disappointment. The wonton noodle soup was brown in color which was odd and there wasn't a vegetable to be seen in the big bowl. Not even a small slice of green onion. Kung Pao chicken seemed to be made with decent quality ingredients, but there wasn't much flavor. The prawns in sweet chili sauce was the best dish and actually very tasty. However, the shrimp or ""prawns"" were too small, but fortunately battered very lightly which kept a good balance you do not see in many Chinese restaurants. Surprisingly, the complimentary Chinese black tea was too diluted and even a bit bitter. That doesn't seem like something that is easy to get wrong, but unfortunately they did. The atmosphere is kind of quaint and the service started well, but after our plates were cleared nobody bothered to wipe up the dirty sauce that dripped across the table and we were stuck with that for the rest of the experience. At almost $60 for dinner for 2 with tip, not sure I would be back for mostly mediocre food. I liked how they brought a separate dish for the fortunate cookies, compared to some places that place them on the dirty money trays with the check. Of course, it is always best when the fortune cookies are wrapped in plastic.  That is the only time I will ever eat them, as who knows where they have been and how they have been handled before arriving. They had some promising signs, but overall it just wasn't a very good experience.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5641,"The marina view and overall atmosphere is nice. The service is mixed, and is challenged to live up to the 20% mandatory service charge that I wouldn't really expect at a restaurant like this. I would expect the service to be so great it earns 20% or more after it is delivered. Our server was good until our check was brought out and my empty water was never refilled then or when my payment was processed. Definitely not 20% service, falling apart at the end like that. The food is just average chain style food at best, and didn't differentiate itself at all to justify the high prices. The $10 house salad was so disappointingly mediocre and such a waste of money. The salad was simple and boring, and the dressing was totally lackluster. The steakhouse burger must have been the worst $18 burger I have ever eaten. The meat was so so and totally dwarfed the bun. The bottom of the bun was soggy and greasy. The burger did not look hand formed, but rather like a factory made pattie, and the texture was the same. Taste may not have even matched a Red Robin burger. On the other hand, the fries were quite nice. The parking spaces have signs saying valet reserved only, but no valet was on duty when we arrived, so we drove around for many minutes trying to figure out where to park before calling the restaurant and finding out we could park ourselves in the valet spot but if not gone in 2 hours we would be ticketed. That's not very classy , and actually quite a ridiculous thing to say. Then, we arrived 4 minutes after the brunch seating ended and instead of being a fine restaurant and seating and accommodating us at a table which we wanted, they turned us to the bar and were totally strict about it being just 4 minutes late. If they would have had valet staffed correctly or the afternoon parking rules appropriately explained with signage, we wouldn't have been late to start with. The over $50 bar bill for food only was a poor value and disappointing experience.  We were starving so we ate the lunch, but I would have been much happier at several other steakhouses, fine restaurants, or even at a Dick's drive in. Even a chain like Ruth Chris is dramatically better from my perspective, and that is pretty sad.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5654,"Let's cut away all the Shiro hype, the overinflated reviews by all the lemmings and tourists, and let's get to the real deal here. The sushi is usually very good at the sushi bar, but the size of the cuts is very small, similar to my pet tropical fish.  The sushi and everything I have had at the lounge tables is usually a huge disappointment and a poor value. It is also a joke that at there prices and small portion sizes they will not accommodate any substitutions for dietary needs per their menu. I really should give them one star for that alone. Also, don't get why they only do. Half hearted lunch in the summer only available outside. Weird. Why not allow indoor seating too? The sushi bar is good, questionable value, but definitely not the best or finest experience in the USA by far. It sucks that they don't take reservations for the sushi bar. If they did, I would go more often, but I just can't deal with wasting my time going there to stand in long lines like a clown, out in all kinds of Seattle weather, not knowing if my trip was a total waste of time or not because I may not even get a seat.  I have no problem spending a lot of money on great sushi, but the line em up like cattle experience to pay a fortune for small pieces of fish does a great job typically keeping me far away from this tourist trap. The servers however, do a great job there keeping drinks filled and needs attended to. I couldn't care less about Shiro being there. I'd rather have a convenient and classier customer experience being able to make a reservation at the sushi bar even if I have to wait days or weeks to get in. Otherwise, they typically drive me to their competition.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

The sushi was mostly OK, but flat and missing any wow factor, and while the appetizers were different than other places, they were mostly void of good taste, freshness, and quality.  It seems like there was more inspiration at this restaurant in how to run it like an assembly line, and make as much profit as possible, rather than focusing on delivering delicious high quality special food with great warm service. Service was just inconsistent and sometimes checked out or totally unattentive. The love was somehow missing in almost all aspects of the experience even though the sushi chef seemed very nice from a personality perspective. If you charge top $ you need to deliver top quality, and unfortunately they really did not.  We are in no hurry to go back, but something tells me they are capable of delivering so much more than they did, and perhaps one day they may step up their game and deliver to their potential. I hope so for them and all customers.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

Also both the men's and women's bathroom were  dirty and unkept, with a black table napkin left in the men's room too. We sat for many minutes before anyone ever greeted us, and 3 of our 5 ordered dishes were served outright cold,  and we had to send them back.  There was no excuse because it was late afternoon and it was not even  busy. If they don't have the energy to be in business properly, they should close and do every body a favor. The food we ate was served pretty presentation wise, but the quality and flavors were average at best. They dress up like a Royal Thai restaurant, but their menu is typical and uninspired.

I would rather light a $50 bill on fire than go there again to order 2 very disappointing cold appetizers and 2 gross orders of dumplings for almost $50 with tax and tip. We were smart enough not to eat very much, and we still felt sick since we went. I love great American Chinese food and authentic Chinese food having travelled extensively across China,  and I can confidently say this is neither. The cucumbers in the cucumber salad were mushy, it did not taste fresh, and the marinade was poorly balanced. The dumplings were too doughy, mushy, and did not smell right either. They were disgusting and the plates were wet with water due to not properly draining the dumplings in a rush before serving them. The chairs were also filthy dirty when we sat down. It was gross, way too expensive, very low budget atmosphere, and somewhere I would not return to ever again even if they paid me.  I've got to learn that the ID does not deliver very often, and to stop trying these overrated underperforming restaurants.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

These bagels are bland, overpriced, baby bagels.  Too small for sure, and no flavor compared to a regular regional competitor we prefer which has more varieties, bigger bagels, and better taste. We tried the lox platter for $13 which was really underwhelming, and the quantity and quality of the smoked salmon was very low end, and cheap stuff compared to what we usually eat. We even got stomach trouble later in the day which may have come from the salmon.  It's hard to say, but we were very suspicious, as it was crap.  Also, I think they go too far with things like only offering less traditional, horrible tasting intensely pickeled onions and some very strong flavored spicy cream cheese. I love middle eastern foods but somehow the non traditonal styles they incorporated into the bagel concept just didn't work for me. Can't believe they don't even have regular onions.  For the same price paid, we can go to nicer restaurants, avoid the parking nightmare, get more service and/or better quality and/or more delicious food.  This is just another dime a dozen Seattle restaurant that dresses up modern, gives you less, goes too unfamilar from the norm trying to be creative, and charges you as much as possible while giving you so very little. I don't see anything hip or cool about that. East coast or any bigger city bagel lovers may also be greatly disappointed.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

The rolls with crab butter were also a big disappointment and a total waste of money spent for me. They were way over priced for rolls, nothing special, and the ""crab butter"" somehow did not work at all for me either. The trout fritters were also a one and done dish I would not try again.  I agree that the service was very immature and confused at times, and poorly coordinated, but some of the staff really stepped up and did a great job.

How can you trust a place to be safe to eat at when they have no pride in the front cleanliness? The whole restaurant needs to be deep cleaned, tidied up, and kept more presentable. As for the food, it was quite mediocre, and generally missing freshness, quality, and soul. Some of the ingredients especially do not seem to be at an acceptable quality level. For example, they serve really bland colorless, probably pre-prepared, overcooked, and/or frozen vegetables as a side with several dishes. It is like gross cafeteria food. Not sure why they even bother if done so poorly.  The samosas are also too hard and doughy.  Would love to see great Indian food in this part of town, but right now without a lot of clean up literally and figuratively, more professional service, and better food quality, it is a no go for me.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

Bait and switch and cheap. Not cool. The shrimp tempura was like eating bricks, as it was so over battered and over cooked. Totally hard and dried out...

For the rest of the evening, we reflected on what a mistake it was to go there.  I will surly go to other restaurants next time in Hartsville.  I am no longer convinced that the Groucho's Deli brand name can equally be trusted in all locations.  Definitely not in Hartsville.  It seemed like a total failure this time.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

5691,"HELLO!  It is time to start joining the modern world and accepting / honoring reservations here!The food is good, even though definitely very high priced, but the long lines, wall to wall crowds of people, noise, pushing and shoving, and the cattle hearding experience to get a table is just too brutal.  The overall experience is just not worth it any more, as this restaurant is too commercial.  This business is not the only one in the world that knows how to serve stone crabs with mustard sauce.   It is almost always an unpleasant experience for me and never worth it.  Too many people and too many tourists come here flooding the place following folklore, travel guides, and concierge recommendations.  However, the class of the old business seems to be long gone.  The unpredictable waits (e.g., 2 hours) and no reservation policy works for them letting customers stand around like putzes for hours to pay a ton of money to eat the food, however I am not going to subject myself to that, and I wish others did not either teaching them a lesson.  It lost the charm from the old days and is now more like other large Las Vegas or Disney World type operations serving the mobs. Even other Joe's outposts in other cities honor reservations now, and I may still consider going to some of those.  The take out and express side of the business is an option, but not a good one unless you want to pay a fortune to eat with plastic, picnic style.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5692,"Over rated, and for me a very mixed result.  Maybe a little too much fusion going on as well...   The egg rolls were kind of tasty but served very oily and not dry enough.  The pot stickers were also a disappointment as they did not seem to be made in house, and they were deep fried vs. steamed and pan fried in a more proper and refined way.  It was interesting that they were served with hoisin sauce, but they were just not very tasty and we wasted some. The dumplings just tasted like the cheaper third party processed crap you get most sub par Asian fusion restaurants these days.  It is easier to buy cheap product, fry it up, mark it up, and seek more profit.  The problem is that customers with any sense of discrimination of what they eat will not return to buy it.   The wonton soup was good, but the dumpling quality was not that good.  The chicken corn soup was a big disappointment, as the chicken in the soup came across like canned mystery meat, regardless of what it was.  It grossed me out and I did not like it.  I tried the honey garlic chicken which turned out to be fried which I did not know.  However, the flavor and the quality of the white meat chicken inside was actually good. The breading was also not too heavy which I liked.  I also appreciated that they did not seem to use mayo in that sauce.  Service was good, but it is probably a 2-2.5 star restaurant from my view.  Not sure I would return, as the quality was just not high enough.  Not easy getting great Chinese food in South Florida these day.  Most places don't put in the effort or quality their predecessors did in the old days.  They seem more worried about making a quick buck than serving excellent quality food... I would recommend to look around to some other options in the area, but keep in mind that there are slim pickings...",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5696,Filthy and in disarray all over this restaurant. An embarrassment for the franchise. This branch does not back up their sign quote that says quality is their recipe. Who is managing quality control for Wendy's these days? Is anyone?,PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5697,"I saw another Yelper write ""What an epic fail"".  That says it all for my recent visit.  La Mar is not even close to what it used to be in terms of the customer service mindset.  It used to wow me a long time ago, but in the last visit, it totally fell flat and had none of the positive spark I remembered before.  My biggest disappointment involved the hotel food and beverage director that did not seem to pay attention to the details of my request or needs when he handled my reservations personally.  During my reservation request, I asked specifically for one of the best tables directly on the edge of the water with the best view, preferably in the middle of those tables for a very very special milestone event.  When we arrived, the 3 hostesses at the front seemed confused, unfriendly, non-engaging, and very flat with a vibe that was quite non hospitable for the initial customer experience.  It was night and day different from how things were there before. Somehow the staff must have changed, and it does not seem for the better.  My wife and I immediately felt the opposite of the way it used to be from the moment we walked in.  There are 3 or more people at the front not focused on starting the customer experience right.  That seems like a big waste. What are they there for then? Then, we were taken to a table that had a stair case in front of it before you could see the water with a more obstructed view from the stairs and some umbrellas, and it was not what I had requested for the very special milestone event and the reservation I made earlier.  The view was sub par to another section of more premium tables with a better view that I originally requested.  However, all of the tables of the type I desired were already given away, and I was told next by the management that they are first come, first served anyway.  It makes me wonder what good a reservation is then, as I was not informed of anything like this during the reservation process with the food and beverage director.  It was not clear any attention was paid to the details I communicated.  When I asked for the management, the general manager and food and beverage director came, but they did not seem to handle the situation very well.  They were not very supportive, but more defensive and in the case of the food and beverage director, he seemed to just want to debate the situation vs. take any ownership or give me the benefit of the doubt and support me after having a bad customer experience.  I perceived the restaurant to not be very into serving customers that night, and I announced that I was immediately leaving before ordering and that I expected my car pulled up as soon as possible.  The food and beverage director could have used this as a chance to be humble and supportive to end on a better note, but instead he walked away with a really angry and nasty look on his face.  I tried to express dissatisfaction about this, but he did not seem to acknowledge that and everything ended as a disappointment for me.  They did get my car ordered promptly, and the manager actually was nicer at the end and polite apologizing to me as I left, so I do give him credit for character then, and trying to do the right thing in the end.  I can not say the same about the food and beverage director.  Anyway, the visit was a total bust for me, and it is a shame for the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Miami that seems to be doing a good job in other aspects of service delivery.  It is sad that their restaurant was so bad of an experience for this visit.  I would have to be crazy to stay there and accept being treated like that.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5699,"The service was quite good and the decor was cute, but the food was just not good at all. There was too much mediocre, fatty, fried, greasy, and overly rich food that made us feel quite bad while we left and for the next couple of hours.  It is a cute theme, but they just didn't deliver good food... We are foodies and open minded, but this place is a flop from our perspective. The bill was huge as well, and in the end this place was only a meh for us.

5702,"If I had to summarize my perceptions of this restaurant in a few words it would be poor experiences all around, completely over rated, unprofessional, not customer focused, not well managed, and a disappointing ""has been"" establishment that lost its way.  It was shocking as a hotel guest at the Fontainebleau, that we still had such a bad experience after making morning reservations for dinner.After a mix of previous inconsistent experiences, I can not emphasize enough how much I will completely avoid and give up on Scarpetta going forward, after this last failed attempt.  I would not return there at any price point. Without going into the pain of communicating every play by play detail, let me say that our initial experiences at arrival were surprisingly very poor and our impressions were that we were treated extremely rudely, unprofessionally, and with disrespect & disregard.  I had to say my name and reservation information 3 TIMES, because the assistant manager and hostess at the front seemed to be completely checked out and almost came across as trying to ignore us.  Unfortunately, we were also treated clearly differently than another party that was fast tracked in front of us while we were forced to wait more after the initial string of multiple customer service errors by the hostess and assistant manager before that. When I asked the hostess why the other small party just arriving was sent in front of us to be seated when we had already been there for a while, and were forced to be waiting unnecessarily on time for our reservation, as they were still not busy, I was told that the assistant general manager knew the other party. Somehow that was supposed to justify giving preferential treatment to those customers over us? It was the ugliest side of Miami where unless you are in the know or inside track with one of those scratch each other's back pretentious places, you are treated differently and with discrimination.  Or maybe, our money was not as good because we were not dining in fancy suits?  Or maybe we were judged and discriminated against as a mixed race couple?  Baffled. After the initial multiple bad experiences, being sidelined to let others arriving later go in front of us was definitely more disrespect and embarrassment to us.  It was also quite difficult to get to speak to the general manager about all of this after requesting him.  I think they did not want me to expose what happened, as they must have known how wrong it was.  However, I still waited and was persistent to share my poor experiences with him prior to leaving.  After expressing my extreme disappointment with my frustrating poor experiences, the general manager did apologize, and he offered that I stay as his guest so he could make things right.  I reluctantly gave him that chance, which turned out to be a huge mistake.   As time went on, I really felt like he did not have his heart into it and just did it without sincerity to really make it right.  This is because instead of turning around the bad situation, the rest of the limited experience there for us was a continued comedy of ridiculous errors and series of mistakes and bad experiences for us.  For example, I was rudely interrupted by the waiter and told how to order for my wife and I, not letting me easily order for her like she requested of me.  It was like he was trying to teach me a lesson of how to let a lady order first, and further embarrassing me and my wife.  Empty water glasses were not noticed and refilled when staff visited the table. Even the wrong starters were served to the wrong person.  We were also served a very disappointing wine when asked for the house to make the recommendation.  The general manager also did not check on us again after seating us.  I could go on as well, but everything that happened was blah.  It was like they hired their staff with no experience, refinement, or ability to serve customers.  It felt pretentious, fake, and not warm at all there.  Nothing was first class or delighting including the food, drink, or the service.  We could not even bare to stay through the first starter course, so we decided to leave.  Even the complimentary meal was such a failure that we could not bare to stay for it.  That is my biggest complaint that they couldn't even get the recovery correct when given the chance.  That really disappointed me, especially with the general manager that could not get things right the second time when given that chance.  We still had to leave and give up on the restaurant unfortunately for good.  I am not willing to give the management and team there a third chance.  I definitely do not see any reason why they should get the awards hanging on the wall.  Whatever earned that, I clearly could not see it tonight.  I also do not think they meet the standards of other restaurants in the Fontainebleau Hotel they are based.  It did not represent the hotel well at all.  There are countless better restaurants in Miami.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5704,"After trying to be a customer several times here for many months, I give the place a big thumbs down now and my most recent trip shall be my last. What really blew this place for me is the poor value and quality of service, but when you look at it, most of the beer is not that great either.  I came in and we asked to try a couple of beers before filling up our growler.  They were so stingy that they only gave one cup for each beer for two people, and there was hardly any beer in either of the cups to try.  We are talking a razor thin line of beer tear dropped into the cup with a little foam.  I asked my wife if I should ask again for another 2 cups for her, but she just gave up.  After I decided to buy (I am not sure why), the pour was really bad and my Growler was presented to me very poorly poured, not filled very high, and with wet beer left messy all over the growler, with no bag offered or anything.  I had to ask or insist both for a bag and to clean the dirty disgusting bottle.  The guy brought a ripped up dirty looking towel from the back to wipe the bottle.  I got the impression the bottle was even dirtier now, and I had to go home and clean it myself.  Meanwhile, while getting zero quality in the customer service, the so-so beer still cost almost $13 with tax to only pour about a couple of pints at home.  I realized I could have bought a whole 12 pack of bottled awesome premium imported beer for the same money.   I was so frustrated and tried to reach the owner at multiple branches of business that I guess he is involved in, but he was not engaged or accessible for my issue, so I gave up and decided to just go to yelp. Also:A lot of this local craft beer craze can be way over hyped as some times it can be ""crap"" beer too.  I believe there is a reason the great commercial brands have been in business for countless years.  It is because they produce consistent quality at a value.  The same can not be said of some of the micro craft breweries popping up all over the region.  Some are actually good, but many are not and way over rated from my perspective.  I often get sick or a head ache after drinking some of these beers.  They are also not cheap, so why waste the money on them?  Especially at a store like this that has deteriorated to such a poor unprofessional customer experience.  The whole thing has become a losing proposition for me,.  I'll stick with Guinness, Sapporo and Stella for now.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5705,"Unfortunately after some great recent meals at other Smithfield's in the eastern part of the state, this branch really disappointed us serving both fries and chicken that were more soft, luke warm, and mushy compared to fresh, hot, and crispy. Service was also forgetful and mistake prone.  I am seeing a lot of variation across this chain from branch to branch which means the brand is not always trustworthy.  Some of the chicken pieces were also not as meaty as usual, but more like mostly bone and skin. It was disappointing, and I would not go out of my way again (like I did today) to come back. My last Smithfield's visit made us very happy. Today we just felt blah as the meal was total blah and a total mistake and waste. Also, I don't understand why shops in the chain do not serve honey. Fried chicken and honey is a timeless tradition, and at the higher prices charged here, you would think you could get some.

We are talking cheap supermarket factory style sushi production here, or even not that good.  The rolls are not well formed, the rice is off, and the ""fish"" is not impressive.  Rolls are covered by fatty mayo sauces and cheap adds that are not healthy, but are probably needed to mask the subpar ""seafood"" they prepare and serve.  The so-so atmosphere is still tacky and definitely can not compensate for the disappointing food and service. The experience is like going cheap on everything, but you still waste too much money and time there anyway.  You get exactly what you would expect from a Sushi restaurant in a strip mall in Durham here.  Beware of the inflated reviews, and the fact that for some reason, some people do come here and seem to like it.  Probably because they have not been to a great sushi restaurant before regardless of traditional or fusion style.  This is pure confusion, and a figurative slap in the face to the art of sushi...",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

IF I return some day in the future, I will see IF it improves, but I'm not sure if I would give them another chance right now...  I really felt like I was treated with disregard and disrespect there by that one server.  Sometimes, it only takes one terrible experience to lose a customer, and that is how I feel about it.  I did report the issue the second day to the manager on duty, and he did do a great job supporting me as a customer in a very professional manner.  However, the damage was already done and the experience just could not be saved.  It seems they need to improve the hiring and training processes to better ensure quality service for customers.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

It is really hard to get good, high quality and authentic Japanese food in the Triangle, especially for those of us that are used to cities that have more mature and higher quality restaurants and food scenes.  This place was better than many around here, but it still seemed to be lacking, in terms of most dishes that were served did not impress.  Nothing came across highly authentic or high quality, although I did enjoy the salad with ginger dressing.  If you like fusion restaurants with decent atmosphere and your food expectations are not too high, you may be fine here.  I was more on the fence if I would ever go back.   I somehow did not trust to order the sushi as my standards are very high in that area, and the sushi bar did not pass my initial visual inspection.  The sushi service came across very amateur and I only want sushi when it is served artfully by highly skilled professionals...  Also, the chicken teriyaki was compromised by being undercooked.  The salad dressing was good, but the miso soup and gyoza were disappointing and nothing special.  They said they buy the gyoza premade outside vs. taking the time and effort make their own in a fresher higher quality way.  Too many restaurants are just lazy and full of short cuts these days.  It is much easier to make and eat better food at home, where you can control your own quality.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

For me, the initial waiting and seating experience is a cross between being herded in a cattle drive, being in a Black Friday morning sale entrance stampede, and being stuck in a Beijing subway car at rush hour... People pushing, shoving, congested everywhere, and blocking the lobby and entrance ways. Isn't that a fire hazard?  The waiting numbers are called out on speakers that are so very loud outside, that you feel you are at a state fair auction. It turns me off before I am even in the restaurant. Bad in all ways... For food, they go low quality in many ways.  They serve canned sliced mushrooms in the egg flower soup without a piece of shrimp in sight. Flavors are lacking and the food last time was a greasy massive sodium bomb that kept me thirsty and feeling bad from the first bite well into the next day.  Clams in black bean sauce were not tasty with the sauce rushed and they even seemed to have grains of sand or some debris in the clams.  The princess prawns are small split shrimp entombed in enough breading to be a small donut. You can barely taste or see the shrimp beneath the fried dough.    I was cursed with higher blood pressure and had nightmares all night of being deprived of water in the middle of the desert after the massive sodium doses in the food that night. Icky...Although the servers do the very best they can, and deserve a pat on the back for hanging in there, the food can take up to an HOUR to serve from the kitchen, and what arrives is definitely NOT worth it.   The bathrooms were gross and there were no paper hand towels. I guess another cost saving measure, so you are forced to touch the bathroom door with your clean hands while other customers, who do not wash their hands after going to the bathroom, touch the same door.  Yes, that happened, and it was disgusting.  I also miss the old almond cookies they used to serve many years ago.  They cut back on that like so many other things to save a buck at the expense of the customer.They have lost their way, and I lost my desire to return.  Sad that they ruined a restaurant that was once great.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

On the last visit, the first pump I went to did not even have a working hose on the pump, but there was not any out of order sign either.  Also a transaction I started there would not even cancel after more than 5 tries.   Another pump did not work correctly either, and did not have a working printer for receipts or car wash codes. This station is a joke. A great place to go if you want to waste an extra twenty+ minutes running in and out of the station and back and forth to the pump accomplishing little to nothing each time.  That is what happened to me and it sucked, just like previous visits when multiple things have been screwed up and the customer experience was also as poor as can be.  Why is getting gas in Chapel Hill more difficult than in a developing country? The car wash also consistently sucks when I use it, and it never gets better. The car wash doesn't clean or dry my car correctly, even after I get the best option available.  I waste time and have issues almost every time I go to this station.  I highly recommend to avoid this station.   Shell obviously has insufficient quality focus to let such mediocracy persist with their brand name... and it never improves...  They need to invest in or build some more quality focus into their culture.  They should be deeply ashamed... and I hope it catches up with them over time, and they get driven out of business by some competitors that care more about the customers...

It doesn't seem to be right the way  their quality drops  and they benefit from many old or current inflated yelp ratings they no longer deserve... All for a marginal to sub par product.

I doubt he even had any time to wash his hands before serving.   In general, the restaurant was just not that professional, the food was marginal, and it was a disappointing experience at such high prices.  If it was better they could have gained a repeat customer.  However, now it is not even likely that I shall ever return.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

Then, on our last visit, one of the meals served from the kitchen was absolutely hideous in terms of really poor meat quality that was way oversized and not cut anywhere close to the usual standard size for the dish.  It was extremely gristly and unusually overloaded with large chunks of fat.  We both were lucky that we did not choke on the gross meat that we ultimately had to spit out onto the plate.   It was totally inexcusable, disgusting, and it has completely destroyed my trust in the kitchen there, to serve something so obviously bad like that to customers. I have never seen such large variation in quality at a cheesecake factory branch before.  I am very sad that I will have to stay away from a chain I have liked for many years due to the very poor kitchen performance and substandard quality at this branch.  The disappointment in the poor food quality was actually so big that we could not even accept any offers to try to fix it.  When a restaurant messes up so bad, I just do not want to even give them another chance.  I care too much about my health and well being.  I also share the disappointment in the management of this branch like other customers, as they did not seem to adequately listen to me or meet my expectations in handling the very unfortunate quality issues.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

There is also a better option  in Bellevue now, where at least you get consistent quality and great service.  This may just be a ""has been"" restaurant now, where the passion has died long ago.  It is really sad, as once it really delivered great sushi.  Now, the soul seems to be gone... and they just sling out mediocre sushi.  I even had to spit out three stringy disgusting cuts of fish into napkins on the last visit.  It was like grocery store sushi.  What the heck was that?  Meanwhile, the Tako tasted like hard rubber with no flavor.  It was the first time ever I left behind sushi there and was so disgusted by the bland and lower quality product and preparation...  Definitely a surprise for the worse.  Really sad...",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

5740,"Service and some earlier plates started Ok before our dinner experience degraded into a total waste and disappointment.  My main dish was completely out of balance.  The sauce was flat, the beef was just meh, and everything else was significantly over salted.  It was a real disappointment.   Even waking up this morning, I feel bad like I have been given a massive salt overdose and my mouth still feels violated by that meal.  Fine French dining does not = drown mediocre food in salt.  They are not worth your trust or money for dinner.  Too expensive to be so mediocre.I did not desire to send the meal back and wait for a fix, and frankly I expect a meal at a restaurant like this to be prepared correctly the first time.  My meal was a total miss.  However, it was a bigger grave disappointment that after explaining the issue to the server AND the manager Pierre (and also specifically being willing to eat and pay for the plate anyway) there was no consideration of an offer of any kind of good will to try and make it a better experience for us.  For example, they could have at least offered us a coffee and/or dessert on the house after blowing the meal, yet they made no effort to do anything like that.  We did not even need dessert, but the fact that it was not even offered showed there is an arrogance and disregard for repeat customers like us.  It is the principle that mattered here and the result is that they had a short sighted and cheap perspective vs. being customer focused and stepping up to make our meal experience better, when they messed it up in the kitchen.  They surely did not show that they cared.  Pierre even said that I should have told him earlier so he could fix it.  I guess his ability to fix anything gets cut off based on the time on the clock.   Well, guess what Pierre... that doesn't help me at all.  Also, we were left standing and waiting too long to collect our checked coats at exit, and I had to flag down and interrupt a food runner to get them.  Nobody else beyond the runner helped us out or thanked us for coming in on the way out.  We left with a bad taste in our mouth both figuratively and literally.That is very short sighted, and will be remembered long after the bad tastes of  last night's bad dinner fade away.  We do not want to come back after last night's disappointing experience...",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

That was the first disgusting thing.  Unfortunately, our food was terrible too...  The salad was old, wilted, discolored, and just not fresh. The Italian beef was so underwhelming and served on toasted hard apparently stale bread.  The French fries were served mushy and disgusting, and worst of all, the cheese on our pizza did not taste fresh, but rather expired and spoiled.We wasted a lot of our meal, and left feeling sick.  The quality of this restaurant was as bad as it gets.

Even the slaw was not as tasty last time. Also, the Texas toast gets really boring after a while compared to a nice roll or bun for a sandwich.  The fries are Ok, but that is nothing more than table stakes...  The service is good, but that does not save the marginal food coming from the kitchen now.Something changed in the kitchen because the love and care from before seems to be totally gone...

I left not feeling full enough after the meal last time I visited.  Service and hospitality overall across multiple visits feels like it should be more refined, experienced, and effective. Service ranges from ok to poor. Service quality and food portion size do not live up to the venue's potential.

Even reporting it to the owner and manager the first time did not fix it, and the same thing happened a week later.  I doubt reporting it a second time even helped, and those communications only frustrated me further.  Today I saw other recent reviews that reminded me of my bad experiences showing that they just don't get it there, and they seem to be ok with mediocrity. Their pizza can not even come close to compensating for the poor frustrating customer experience and incorrect orders that seems to be the new norm there. I decided to eat frozen pizzas and visit several other pizza businesses in the area with better product and service, as Brenz really let us down, and ruined two meals in a row, leaving a bad feeling with us as well...",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5756,"I wonder if the higher reviews of this newly opened restaurant are from friends of the owners... because I do not get this place at all...   I had a chronically disappointing experience and left.  The place is compact, crowded, and not very roomy or comfortable.  You are herded through a fast food cattle line just to get to a counter of what appeared to be staffed by inexperienced kids throwing together lackluster tacos and other fast-food taco stand items in a very mechanical, non-confident, non-passionate, cafeteria mentality way.  It seems that most of the food comes out of bins of previously prepared food.  The chicken was not even close to appetizing as it was served as dark, dried-out, scrappy pellets of meat from the bottom of a bin.What is interesting is that when you add it all up, you seem to still pay similar to a nicer full service, more authentic Mexican restaurant.  Meanwhile here, you are crammed into the too small, latest chain, fast-food place, eating non inspiring food, and using cheap disposable plates and utensils.  Where is the pleasure in that?  The flashy name and branding, neither the mural on the wall, could not save this place for me.  This restaurant also makes an already tight parking situation at Meadowmont even worse... I think we need fewer restaurants like this, and several more better & special ones around here to make it worth the parking competition... Meadowmont is becoming more and more another planned community filled with too many ""dime a dozen"" chain and fast food restaurants missing originality, soul, and character.  I could eat the same things in most strip malls anywhere in the country... and even go to better Mexican chains than this too. Will not be coming back any time soon.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

5759,"They have a nice atmosphere and a good downtown location.  However, it seems to be too crowded and pricey for what is being delivered.   The service was below average, pizza was unfortunately below average for the style of pizza they are serving, and the side dishes were very pricey and just not special.  I think they could be much better if they improved the quality of preparation of their pizzas including the selection of ingredients, proportions of ingredients, and the quality of preparation.  For their prices, I expect so much more.  They are charging top prices common in the bigger metropolitan cities and unfortunately not delivering a comparable product.  I also recommend reworking salads and side dishes for bigger portions and better tastes.  Maybe a nice  in-house made sea salt, chocolate chip cookie cooked in their pizza ovens for dessert would be nice move to up their game...  They need something a lot more than what I experienced to get me back...",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5760,"Some others are right that the service model is the detrimental issue here. The lunch ""self"" or ""no"" service model does not work, and gets worse each time, scaring us from returning. You have to stand in a slow, inefficient, bottlenecked, single server line to order and then self seat in what was designed to be a full service restaurant. If your tested patience survives the brutal host stand line wait,  you next are pressured to process the menu and complete your order uncomfortably standing up, holding the menus with other customers waiting behind you, also frustrated in a hurry trying to get their lunch. You also have to pay first becoming trapped  by the restaurant. After that, you must find your own table and have to walk around the restaurant to find and get your own utensils and drinks. Meanwhile, the many outside patio tables are not fully cleaned and wiped down. Many seats were left with water puddles on them, after over night humidity on our last visit, for customers to sit on, if not careful.   After sitting, you have to walk across the restaurant again, likely to another room to refill your own drinks such as water, tea, or soft drinks. They don't even bring ketchup or any condiments with a burger meal, so you have to get up and find it at a bus stand yourself like a treasure hunt, or you have to ask for a favor from the food runner if you can catch them fast enough.  Also, it is not good that they serve nice bread and butter at dinner but do not offer it at lunch. They need to work on flow, service, consistency, and just common sense about how to treat customers right at this restaurant.  It really looks from the outside like they are trying to kill their lunch business, doing everything wrong from a broken service model perspective. There are countless customer ""pain points"" that surely will drive customers away including myself. The food is simple, but some is actually pretty tasty if you find the right dishes and you miraculously go when the restaurant rarely turns on a real service and hospitality model. Unfortunately that is hit or miss.. Apparently, more likely a miss... As a benefit, you can probably add restaurant experience to your resume after dining here, as at lunch, you do all the work!!!

It was a horrible smell combined with the worn looking room totally turning us off. It was so unappetizing and unprofessional for a restaurant, we obviously had to leave. They have a lot of work to do here, and need to put in much more effort to care for their business and customers...  No way I can trust eating their food any more, when they can't even get the basics right.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5766,"Besides numerous mistakes and big frustrations with their delivery, the biggest issue for me here, whether it be dine in or delivery, is that the sauce and cheese used in the pizzas are just not special or high quality compared to what I am used to. Their ingredients remind me of cheap canned tomato sauce and low grade, low cost cheese.  The result for me is a very marginal total lack of flavor in their pizza...  That taste is something that I do not want to eat or serve to either friends or family.  If you enjoy mediocre and marginal NY style pizza, you may be fine. However, a discerning foodie will likely be quite disappointed. Beverage selections and salads are good. On the other hand, there could be much more proactive cleaning of tables between customers at rush times... Again, I would raise my review if they used higher quality, less cheap, and more inspired sauce and cheese in the pizza... Very disappointed in the minimal effort using the apparent low quality ingredients...",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5768,"The first big miss was that they ran out of fresh blue crabs only a little over an hour after opening. Not impressive for a ""Crab House"" which wasn't that busy to begin with. Fried oysters were not very good in terms of the actual oyster flavor and quality, and they had too much heavy breading.  Fried shrimp were not much better either, leaving quite a lot of oil behind in the basket. A bigger disappointment was that the shrimp were not all fully deveined. Seeing the black veins was really gross.French fries were hand cut, but way over salted past enjoyable, so we did not finish them.  Also, the usage of quite cheap plastic cups and utensils seems to be cheap, not environmentally friendly, and wasteful.  I am also not a fan of the small cheapest plastic forks and knives they used. I could not imagine anything lower in quality than those.  The simple rustic atmosphere is fine, but the utensils don't have to be the quality of a carnival food truck.Service was friendly and attentive, and the cole slaw was probably as good as it gets, but the portion size was way too stingy, in what seemed like a very small plastic sauce cup.  We really left feeling blah and unsatisfied with our meals after departing... Would not recommend this place or be in any hurry to return.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5770,"My advice is to drive by and do not stop here...  Nothing was cute or nice about our entire experience here.  The service was totally unprofessional and outright rude and nasty.  One young lady was serving 13 tables and also working the cash register.  However, she did none of her tasks well, and she acted unpleasant the entire time I observed her.  She seemed to hate working there, which also made me as a customer hate being there.   Many tables around us, including us got incorrect or incomplete orders brought to the table.  In our case, things were never fully fixed.  The food was also poor and not fresh tasting.  Fried food tasted like it was cooked in spoiled old oil, and all of the food ranged from lousy to medicore except for the cole slaw which was respectable.  Several other BBQ businesses in the Triangle area operate at such a higher level of quality in terms of food and service delivered.  I will go there and never come back here again,  A complete lack of southern hospitality and quality.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

I much prefer a harder and colder texture / temperature. What I was served was a very small, not too good tasting waffle cone with two small scoops of underwhelming ice cream that cost well in the four dollar range. The value was poor. Other businesses make better tasting ice cream, and I am always gravely disappointed when ice cream cones at home with grocery store ice cream, taste far better than a parlor like this.

Found a bit of fat and gristle in a burger which is surprising at their price point not to be using leaner higher quality beef. They also were extremely tight with the purse strings not making any effort for good will when they made some mistakes.  I was not too thrilled to perceive a penny pinching management approach, when paying such high prices for questionable value to start with...",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

The service is decent, and the place is beautiful, yet most of the food had such poor flavor and low quality compared to countless other good to great restaurants of this type across the nation. The food was also extremely oily/greasy and way over salted. The sushi seems kind of low grade as well, with them pushing cheap tilapia and artificial crab sticks made from fish as a couple of examples of what they are about.  We are talking grocery store sushi quality at best.

I thought I would give them another chance later, but that next experience even frustrated me so much more, motivating me to cancel my order all together.After being polite and accepting the cold pizza on the first delivery, the 2nd time I called back and asked to speak to the manager who I believe was named Carlos.  I asked him if he could please take my order and make sure that the delivery came hot this time.  A very simple and reasonable request.  Unfortunately, in the middle of our conversation and providing my address information to him, he abruptly put me on hold, and then I waited for quite a while until somebody else answered the phone again.  They wanted me to start from the beginning, and asked me to repeat all of my information again, that I had already told the manager a few minutes earlier.  How rude to be disregarded by the manager like that.  I explained the situation and asked for the manager to be polite to come back to the phone and finish handling my order, which seemed appropriate, especially because I was already giving the place a 2nd chance.  After asking for this twice, I was told both times that the manager refused to come to the phone because he was too busy making pizzas.  Obviously, that manager is too busy to manage issues when something goes wrong.   That was terrible service and a very poor strategy.  Beware to do business with a place like this where the manager abandons you and just doesn't care when you are only asking for reasonable support.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5798,"This small simple restaurant does come across as authentic, and there were definitely some interesting spicy flavors there, but the overall experience including some of the food quality was a total let down after the many high ratings I saw on Yelp.  It is counter ordering and a no frills experience at prices that you may typically pay for full service in a much more decorative and comfortable restaurant.  Portion sizes are OK, but the quality of the dishes and preparation mistakes were the biggest concern for my party.We waited a reasonably long time for our food in a rather boring and plain environment. No music, no festivity, not much decoration to speak of...  Just a TV playing a loud volume drama show in Spanish. No chips are offered or sold here, so we just waited kind of bored in anticipation of our food.  All of that would have been fine, except the Carne Asada in our tacos were way too fatty, grisly, dry, and poor tasting. The meat did not seem fresh either. Another dish had promise in flavor but came out way too cold, which was very disappointing. Some of the lettuce looked wilted, and avocado portions were also rationed significantly. On the positive side, their rice was fantastic. Maybe we caught a bad day, but I just did not see what justifies the very high star ratings previously given. The value seemed poor, and I was also disappointed that there seemed to be insufficient effort to clear snow and ice from their entrance area when open for business a couple of days after the recent storm... That was a safety risk which was unnecessary.  I regretfully can not see how I can rate this restaurant higher than a star based on my disappointing overall experience.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

This restaurant's management should use half of the effort they spend in denial, listening to their fleeing customers and realizing there are serious quality issues that would be wise to take ownership of and attempt to fix, instead of debating them.I originally gave an average review here because I had a mixed experience of quite inconsistent food and service quality.  This included quality issues with the clams, which I perceived could be a significant health risk.  I probably should have originally given less stars than three, but I tried to give them every benefit of the doubt hoping to go back again to seek better experiences, after improvements were made.   However, when the management of the restaurant responded to my review ignoring some of the worst aspects of my experience and debating others with a soap box speech of how well they do everything, I saw a serious lack of customer focus, ownership, and accountability for the quality they deliver.  When I updated my review based on the total customer experience, I received even more disappointing comments from the management. I can never support restaurants that operate with this type of philosophy not being customer focused.  I don't intend to go back again, and this is the story of how they earned my one star rating.  Beware...",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5812,"Having horse racing as a very important tradition in my life, and after visiting countless tracks around the world, it is disgraceful how poor the quality of racing, service, and everything has become here. I am utterly disappointed how this track has transformed itself from a place that used to offer an easy, enjoyable, customer focused, and personal experience to one of an institutionalized mediocre amusement park where you are treated like cattle. The prices keep going higher and higher, while many things there seem to continuously degrade in quality to be more designed for the convenience of the track vs. customers.  The quality and value of most things at this track keep getting worse. It is terrible... Over the years, I tried to reach out to leaders at this track multiple times to provide constructive feedback, and on multiple occasions either nobody was available, and when I did reach a leader multiple times through persistence (once with a vp title) they came across indifferent, arrogant, and lacking any sense or ownership and accountability.  They must have thought they were smarter than me, as they did not even seem to listen to me, and only argued or made excuses basically ignoring all of my issues. I saw zero bias for any positive action to improve their service quality.  That shows a poor corporate culture with insufficient values of quality and customer focus, and only a deluded sense of entitlement for business.  The most disgraceful thing was an Arlington Million Day one year in the past, where the highly priced food and experience was absolutely poor and lacking any sense of quality for my table of six in the Million Room.  I actually saw the chairman of the track walking around the room that year and met him briefly. I told him I was sorry to share we were having such a poor experience, and explained what had happened. I was shocked as nothing was done by anyone after that discussion to improve the experience or make the problems right after that discussion. Terrible failure and lack of customer focus... Even the leader at the highest level did not care enough to improve poor service and quality.    Because this track keeps charging more and offering less, while not seeming interested in what customers loyal for life have to say, they have lost the loyalty, attendance, and betting money of me and countless other friends, horseplayers, and recreational attendees I know...Arlington Park is a showcase of a downward spiral of increasingly poorer quality and customer service each year for me.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5813,"I found the taste of my ice cream to be slightly below average at best.  It was served too soft, melting immediately even on a cold night, and the prices were way too high for the very small portions that were served.  It was kind of like a food truck experience, as customers have to buy ice cream at a window and stay outside.  The impersonal experience also reminds me of a transaction at a gas station or currency exchange.  So, you get even less value because of that. Meanwhile young inexperienced servers running the shop seemed to be poorly trained, lazy, and delivered below average service. Didn't live up to the hype at all and likely a one and done experience for me.  I prefer the ice cream I buy at the markets, for a more enjoyable experience...",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5814,"Slow poor service, unprofessionally run restaurant, dirty environment, and lackluster food. They seem so lazy and uncommitted, as they only serve flavorless, processed, plastic to go packages of sweet duck sauce and hot mustard with the egg rolls even when you dine in... That is ridiculous not to even put in a little effort to make their own sauces and present it nicely.  Not much better than airport or food mall Chinese food.  Nothing impressed there...    Just another example of a restaurant doing the bare minimum at the expense of customers.  What happened to the wonderful American Chinese restaurants of days gone by where service and food quality was a matter of pride?  It is a shame how many local Chinese restaurants like this ruin the reputation and image of one of the finest and richest cuisines in the world, by not focusing on quality in all aspects of their business.  They can not even do American style Chinese food right with quality, and that is really a pity.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5817,"Not very impressed, and probably would not go back.  The chicken dinner was all dark meat, and it would have been nice to have a wing and/or breast in there for some balance... The brisket of beef po boy sandwich also was a huge disappointment with very little meat and way too much fat and gristle content in the meat slices served.  I was told they cut away most of the fat, but I did not see that happen at all.  Therefore, I had to pick off large strips and chunks of fat by hand, leaving too little meat behind.  Also, the lettuce, tomato, and mayo did not help that sandwich at all...The Pig fell way short for me compared to many other great BBQ places I have visited throughout the country.  The only exception was the pickled cucumber salad that was made well and was very tasty. However, the coleslaw was just average at best, and the fries were warm and soft vs. hot and crispy.  The prices were a bit high too, so overall it seemed like a poor value, mostly because the food left me very disappointed.The service was nice and professional though...",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5818,"I am afraid they are rushing and shortcutting the quality of their food way too much, trying to squeeze profit out of the business, and not putting love and care into what they serve customers.  They need to slow down, not be so cheap, and do things right, so they do not kill their business. Some of the food dishes are loaded with oil to a degree you feel sick, and those dishes are also prepared very sloppily. The ratio of meat to vegetables in several dishes is ridiculous... There is so little meat, that the dish has no balance.  For example the ""Mongolian"" dishes are mostly consisting of a massive amount of oily, greasy onions with very little meat. That is an unhealthy and a bad tasting way to serve food.An egg roll ordered was burnt black on the surface, which is also unacceptable. That shows no care in preparation or presentation. The poor texture of the chicken in fried chicken dishes also is extremely disappointing. They need to use larger and better quality carefully cut chicken breast pieces if they want to be good for their customers. What was totally disappointing was that they charged me an extra $1 for white meat and still served dark... That made me feel very cheated.I also suspect the salt and/or msg content is way too high making you feel very thirsty and dry in the mouth long after the meal.Service is also a bit inexperienced and overwhelmed, leading to situations like your water does not get refilled, or you must wait very long for the check after dinner (after asking multiple times).  Also, when asking for a few chopped green onions on the side of a dish, they responded ""no, we do not have any"", after checking in the kitchen.  That is ironic and so cheap, as other dishes had stir fried green onions in them, obviously indicating they had green onion, and where either to lazy or cheap to give us a just a few to better enjoy one of the dishes.  That shows a real lack of customer focus.  I do not think I have ever encountered a Chinese restaurant in my life that would not accommodate a request for a few pieces of chopped green onion on the side...They need to improve a lot and not be another crappy restaurant that serves low quality food.  That is where this place seems to be heading... I expect much more and will gladly and generously award my business only when high quality and carefully prepared healthy food is served.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5819,"Very cool theme, nice atmosphere, and engaging service.  Unfortunately, two items on my burger were wrong and not what I ordered.  Also, the fries were served cold, or at best room temperature.  The burger also was served a bit rare, which is not my preference.  It is a bit pricy for a meal there, and for that reason, I hope they step it up a bit and impress me a lot more, if I come back again some day... More effort should also be made to trap and get rid of the pest flies in there.  They were a really annoyance to my meal eaten at the counter.  I need noticeable improvement before I can award more stars...  However, I may try again someday, as they appear to have potential!",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5821,"Sad to say that much better chicken and coleslaw can be found at the super market.  Even the iced tea was not good.  The overnight waiting left-over chicken was disappointing and not fresh.  Nothing impressed us. The whole meal reminded me of a gas station food counter, but maybe not even as good... This restaurant needs a time out to clean up literally, and also to dramatically improve the food and service quality... If you're sober and looking for a great meal, I suggest looking elsewhere.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5822,"We love great Persian food, and countless other beautiful international foods, and any good food including nice vegetarian for that matter, but this place was none of the above. This place was absolutely terrible for my wife and I. We are one and done.  The lunch was very expensive around the mid $30s for two.  There was no value added for us at all.  We even threw away most of our meal.  I just hope I do not vomit soon, as I have felt terrible ever since the meal.  We seemed to get almost nothing mentionable for the money, and we felt very sick after eating our poor meal there... I would rather throw my money in the garbage can next time, than have to face eating another meal there.The food tasted greasy, some items were black and burnt, and the meal did not seem healthy at all. Nothing tasted fresh or well prepared, and the presentation of everything was even poorer, with everything stuffed in the smallest imaginable Styrofoam container. Even the utensils are the cheapest imaginable plastic...  Everything was so poor and we really felt like we were so very badly cheated, and the meal was a big joke on us... I hope the joke is not on you too....  They do not even take credit cards... and you have to pay by cash or check only.  Nothing about this place seemed good or convenient or enjoyable for us.This place made even most work cafeterias look like a 3 Michelin Star Restaurant in comparison.  It is also hard to find and get there, and there only tables are outside and not looking too clean either...  This was an unbelievably bad experience I would not wish on anyone.  Hence, I write this review as a warning ...",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

5825,"After a couple of very disappointing visits, I barely can give this restaurant 2 stars.  I feel obligated to rate it though, as the highly inflated ratings are totally not deserved at all from my perspective.  I definitely expect so much more from a restaurant of this type.   Even though it is hard to get great Chinese and Asian food in the area, this place seems to fall way short of other places we prefer in the Triangle.  It seems as if they are more concerned about collecting money here while delivering small portions, mediocre food, and service, instead of putting any love, passion, and care into their food and service.We ordered multiple dishes, most that came out greasy, loaded with salt and/or msg, and left me and my wife feeling kind of crumby afterwards.  The soup was almost exclusively broth with very little else in it, and nothing we ordered was memorable enough to want to come back.The service was also forgetful and mediocre at best...  It's a definite pass for me...",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5827,"Although I could see some potential here, I just was not seeing or tasting the happiness...  Too many aspects of the restaurant including the food ranged from average at best, to well below average.  For example, the sliced carrot garnish was served black and discolored. That was totally unappetizing. Meanwhile, some pieces of chicken had too much fat or cartilage, and I had to spit them out. Not nice surprises... The fried rice was served very oily even though it had some good flavors, the fortune cookie tasted stale, and the vegetable dumplings were quite poor... It was very disappointing to hear from the staff that the dumplings are not made in house, but bought outside.  Just another example of a restaurant taking too many shortcuts and not putting enough love and care in their food.  I just expect much more from a restaurant...",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5829,"It was such a huge disappointment. The menu described healthy Chinese food, yet the egg rolls came out deeply soaked with greasy oil inside, totally ruining the appetizer course.  Nobody checked on us either to see if they were OK after served, so we made the mistake of getting ourselves sick trying to eat them.  It also looks like this dinner in general may have ruined my well being the rest of the night, as I have felt sick for several hours after I left the restaurant. One chicken dish was kind of tasty even though the chicken slices were so very very small.  The much bigger disappointment was the General Tso Shrimp, which seemed to be composed of much more heavy batter than shrimp inside. When trying to manually remove the petrified tomb of hard dry heavy fried batter around the small shrimp hiding inside, I got my next worse surprise which was that some of the shrimp were not cleaned or deveined showing long dark and dirty green veins and waste along the top of the shrimp. It could not have been prepared or presented any more poorly....  I showed the staff, but they did not really seem to have anything to say about that.  I just left most of the dish behind uneaten, as I was pretty disgusted at that point.Even one of the fortune cookies was flat, smashed, and defective in the bag when served to me. That was after I had to ask four times to different people for the check. The staff blamed the manufacturer and then kid working there for serving that cookie to me, but that was not deserved as for a period of quite some time, the kid was the only person available in the front of the business to provide any help to anyone.  I was not sure why all the other staff were in the kitchen so long leaving the kid alone in the front. They definitely were not helping to resolve any of my issues.It was also interesting that when I reported everything to the staff that worked there, nobody seemed to hesitate to even think of how they could possibly attempt make it right with even the slightest good will adjustment, charging me full price for that totally disappointing meal. The other interesting experience was sitting at the big table there looking at a dirty wall and a red table cloth under the rotating table that was old and ripped in several places. This restaurant fell way short in quality, healthy preparation, and the professional restaurant practice that I would expect.  The other reviewers that gave the low reviews before are right one!",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5830,"Although the service was friendly and sincere, the food was mediocre at best, not of high quality, and a real poor value for me.  A total disappointment and so overrated. If it was great, I would not mind paying whatever it would cost, but this food is not worth it to me at any price.I do not know how this place got 4-5 star ratings.  Just because there is a serious void of excellent Japanese food in this region, it does not mean mediocre food should be overrated.  It is a disservice to those of us who seek and require high quality dining experiences.The salad lettuce tasted like it was not washed, and I even found the core stem of the lettuce in there.  Gyoza dumplings are frozen and purchased from an outside vendor vs. being made in house with love and care.  That is number one sign you should dine somewhere else... Always be sure to ask about that.  If you like being served unknown processed food, than maybe this is the restaurant for you... Everything seemed rushed with too little care in preparation.  That is totally unacceptable.I did not even think of trying or trusting the sushi here, after seeing all of the short cuts and lower quality of other foods.  I love sushi, but I will not, and can not, eat sushi I can not trust.This is just another example of a moderately high priced restaurant serving pretty poor food that is not close to authentic or representative of what Japanese food can and should be.  Will a real/good/quality Japanese restaurant please stand up around here?",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5833,"Update to Original Review: After writing my review below sharing my very poor experience there, I received a message from the restaurant thanking me for not wanting to come back.  I wanted to share that with all yelpers, as it says it all about this restaurant.  I wish I could lower their rating down an additional star if I could after that response, but unfortunately 1 star is the already lowest rating possible on Yelp. Original Review: I would highly recommend avoiding what we found to be a very unprofessional, underwhelming, and extremely annoying restaurant.  My wife is Thai and my family were embarrassed that this kind of Thai restaurant is even being operated in San Francisco. It is very small and not really an enjoyable environment to be in.  We sat down with a kid and after being ignored for quite a while trying to figure out how this strange restaurant even operates, an employee lacking manners and hospitality rudely asked us to move like we were cattle to another just slightly smaller high seat table (which my family was not comfortable sitting at to begin with).  He did not even welcome us or greet us yet. He was just in a rush to move us in a very annoying nervous way... He came across to us so pushy, impolite, and irritating, and all of this was just so that they may have an extra small stool/seat or two that could be squeezed in at that not so big table IN CASE a bigger party MAY COME later that week night evening.  I am so disgusted by restaurants that only think of themselves and not the customers and treat you so poorly and disrespectfully. They did not deserve my business. There obviously was no sense of customer focus here.  If they are this cheap in terms of where and how they sit you, I surely wouldn't trust them to serve quality food ingredients either.  We immediately left, as we got nothing but bad vibes from the moment we walked in.By the way, before we left. the paper menu (after we finally found one) was quite small and not that interesting either.  Service appears to be possibly be do it yourself except when some non hospitable clueless staff member tries to inconvenience you or move you.  I couldn't figure out if it was a restaurant or a fast food stand. It is definitely not spacious or comfortable in there in terms of seating either.  The food on other tables did not look that good to us either.  The neighborhood is also very edgy and best to avoid at night unless you are already there anyway.   I still would recommend going somewhere else to eat though...We left offended and disgusted to never come back again.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5834,"I would not recommend this restaurant unless you were starving and there were absolutely no other options available.  The eggs rolls were so greasy and they tasted like they were cooked in very low quality oil over used, stale, and not fresh at all.  The whole restaurant seemed to be going through the motions and nobody seemed to care about what they did or how they did it there.  The chef should spend less time talking on the cell phone while she cooks, and do a better job cooking... But I'm not sure that will help either. Would not return if they paid me to...The good news is it's cheap. The bad news is that if this kind of restaurant represents the quality level of four Yelp stars in San Francisco for Thai food or any food, it is a sad state of affairs.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5837,"Hmmm... I don't believe the hype at all.  Mediocre so so drinks that did not impress... accompanied by decent but very basic and simple food that did not differentiate itself or justify the visit for us.The good service was probably the best experience there. However, unfortunately nothing was a wow experience, beyond the novelty to ring the door bell to get in with a nice greeting.  The rest of the experience behind the door was kind of underwhelming.Seemed like ultra casual and underdressed and under impressing clientele the night we visited. The speak easy door bell thing was cute but it was hot and muggy inside with no air conditioning and their inadequate drapes did not even block the sunlight shining through... Kind of a dive and just not special enough for me to understand why others have rated it higher. Doesn't make my tope 50 list of similar types of venues I would visit.  I would not rush back any time soon.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

I went twice within two years just to be sure,  Very basic underwhelming food in terms of ingredient quality, quality of preparation, and most importantly taste.Service was impatient and below average at best... not very attentive and with no willingness to do any substitutions.Everything seemed over priced for what it was, nothing was special besides the novelty of the older venue, and parking is extremely difficult.

We were told the Gyoza was not made in house and frozen, we were told there was no real crab in any of the sushi menu items but only imitation crab, the service was grossly understaffed and highly confused, and worst of all we witnessed unbelievable poor hygiene and potential contamination actions behind the sushi bar. This provoked us to to report it to the staff on hand and leave before we even ate...  surely never to return again.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

The sandwich totally falls apart into a mess, and not delicious enough to make it worth while. My salmon was over cooked and dried out...  and there is insufficient space to dine. Very crowded and unpleasant inside. It's almost a fight to get a seat there and completely disorderly and chaos to find that seat...

Too many other more enjoyable places to dine with even better food...",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5844,"They deserve negative stars... This was the poorest fast food service I have seen in quite a while. It is obvious why this location has the lowest rating out of other local stake and shake restaurants... We ordered our food three different times and they still couldn't get it right. After twenty minutes we still did not even get our water. The employees had no sense of direction and there was clearly no leadership to even ensure the most basic level of service.  The manager was completely unable to deal with the numerous performance issues there or to make matters right. There didn't appear to be any empowerment or proper customer service training at the management or employee level. We even noticed an employee at the grill use the same spatula with raw meat  to immediately pick up a bun potentially leading to cross contamination. I hope whoever ate the burger does not get sick. In fact, when trying to address the issues with the manager, we were aggressively antagonized and provoked by an employee in a hostile way.  What a terrible experience we had there. Will never go back!!!! After being a life long steak and shake customer,  I now doubt I will ever dine in any of their restaurants again after my recent experience at this branch. I am not convinced the company stands for quality or customer service any more. I will support other emerging businesses and forget about this restaurant that has obviously lost its way from what it once was. I am so glad I left and did not spend my money there... After too much wasted time and total frustration.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5852,"Very sad that the food was so poor and disappointing on the last visit.  Everything looked and tasted off, and the food was so obviously not prepared with the care that it could and should have been.  I am not sure what happened in the kitchen.   I could go into great lengths about what was wrong with the food, but I will save myself the energy typing.  Let's just say there are several other Mexican restaurants that I trust and enjoy much more in the city now. On the other hand, the service was good last time.  You just never know what your going to get on each visit with this place.This restaurant seems far too inconsistent, as if they are not serious about the quality and consistency of their business.  Sometimes you get great servers and food, and other times you get very unpleasant service and poorly cooked food... It is always a surprise and too often not a good one.  I wonder if the owners are only there part of the time, and the other time the restaurant is not managed?I need a break now, as when things are off, the experience can be so bad that I find it to be a ruined meal, and I regret I even came here.  I feel that way too often here.  It makes me sad, because I know they are capable of so much more.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5854,"I can't imagine why or how this restaurant got four stars on Yelp. First of all, there was an ant crawling on the table, but I would like to pretend it was alone.  More importantly, food and service quality was so seriously lacking, that this had to be a one and done experience for me.The kung pao shrimp was a total flop for me, as it had the most overpowering sour flavor I have ever tasted in that dish.  Flavors were completely out of balance, and not enjoyable.  The unpleasant sourness totally drowned out any other taste of spicy, salty, sweet, etc.The egg rolls were mediocre at best with such limited and boring filling... mostly air... The blah egg rolls were served with a heavily rationed and quite  miniscule side of sweet sauce.  Were they trying to be stingy?  The server looked shocked when I asked for hot mustard, although she did bring it. The hot and sour soup was the brightest aspect of the meal, but just average to me at best.Service and communication (if you don't speak Chinese) was also quite poor.  It seemed like Chinese customers got better service, or at least better communications. I am not sure why they do not have more of a bilingual server working there.I just hope I don't catch whatever made the server cough so much. Water was never refilled ever, and my glass remained empty from the time I was eating until I paid and left.  Very inattentive, but maybe water needs to be rationed too, to only one per customer.  They also charge an extra fifty cent credit charge surplus fee on any bill paid by a credit card that is not over $10. All these penny pinching moves definitely did not earn my trust or repeat business. They just drove me out the door without any desire to return.  Parking was quite limited on the property too.

5855,"I don't get the hype at all. I had such high hopes, only to be incredibly disappointed. At best, it was worth the trip just to know I am not missing anything special if I never go back again. It was extremely crowded and hectic in the way too small space, you wait in a very long line to order fast food style, are crowded at communal tables if you can even find a seat, have to deal with runners shouting out the names of the orders, while people are trying their best to avoid bumping into each other, and you have to clean up your own table. Still paid almost $50 for lunch for two including tip. Was not at all worth dealing with any of this or the Pioneer square parking. Maybe I had bad luck with the menu when I went, but the pastas looked nothing like the photos I saw on yelp, and after ordering two salads, two pastas, and bread, nothing really impressed me in terms of portion size, value, or most importantly taste. Italian food and pasta are definitely among my favorite foods in the world.  It is incomprehensible to me why so many yelp reviews are so inflated. Really? I believe it is just too many folks caught up in the hype and a lack of context in terms of what real top dining and service experience can be on a national or global stage whether it be formal or ultra casual. Let people keep lining up like cattle and getting treated like fast food diners, eating small portions of average food at best, overpaying, and letting the restaurant owners laugh all the way to the bank.

We ordered around closing, and were literally asked to leave multiple times and rushed out the door before we could sit and enjoy the drinks and cookies we just ordered. We also were not given the option for anything but paper cups, which seemed like a rude gesture considering they were not closed yet, and multiple customers were still shopping and lounging there.The door literally was shut behind us and locked immediately the second we walked out. The customer was not first at all, and rather an annoyance when the impatient staff just wanted to prepare to leave the exact second the whistle blew, kind of like a Flintstones  cartoon.This business and the parent company should be ashamed of the ugly showcase of poor customer service that was demonstrated there.There are more outstanding places to go in Seattle where I know I will get great food, coffee, and most importantly customer service.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

The hot and sour soup was very unsatisfying in flavor, and there was some kind of hard cartilage meat like substance in it that ended the soup experience for me. The main dish of sesame chicken was edible but nothing special.  Meanwhile, the complimentary brown wilted salad with some kind of white creamy dressing was frankly a no starter. I also took one bite of the pan fried pot stickers, and then ended up leaving behind the entire plate. This is a good restaurant to go to if you want to start a diet.

5874,"The food is average here at best, and usually a disappointment.  It is kind of amazing that my bill was over $50 for a simple burger lunch for 2 adults and a  child last time... and the two adults shared a shake.  Because of the recent Seattle ice cream scare, they seemed to have chosen a sub par brand to use in the interim and the shake was quite poor.  Not a good choice to use that ice cream (if it was the brand that the server told me) vs. an alterative higher quality brand.  I have dined here several times, and some days it is better than others, but on my last meal, it wasn't very satisfying or enjoyable at all.The biggest issue is that the food is not very special.  It is just very basic and overpriced. The burgers are kind of small and not too tasty, and almost everything is an up charge on them.  The salads are also average at best, the shakes are inconsistent, and the tater tots and onion rings are often too greasy and oily.  It would be nice if they had a nice coleslaw or something that came with the burgers to make it almost seem special.  Parking and access by car is challenging, and you need a key code (and to walk across the building outside of the restaurant) to go to the bathroom.  In general, not much is convenient at this restaurant.The atmosphere and window views are cute here, but the seating is not very comfortable.  In the main dining area, which is not very spacious, it is common to feel scrunched up with the next table, and the chairs are very simple too.  The bar is typically a better place to be for space if you do not have kids along, and you do not mind higher stools.  Sitting outside is probably the best option in the Summer.The service is the one thing that is actually very good here, and I compliment that.If you are an inexperienced diner, chain restaurant dining person,  and/or not used to excellent food, I believe that you may like this restaurant.  If you are like me, and have often eaten much better food at much better value, you will likely be very disappointed by the size of your bill and the kind of food they serve.I would rather either upgrade to a higher end restaurant for a great burger meal paying even more for great quality and portion size, or even take it down to better fast food options...  This place is too average in the middle for me (except for the high prices)...",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5877,"I DO NOT love the kind of sushi they serve HERE, and I DO NOT like this restaurant anymore... It has changed too much and NOT in the right direction.  I believe it is foolish to overpay here for the very disappointing food and service I got.  I had a Hamachi hand roll that was a bloody sloppy mess of the poorest cut of Hamachi I may have ever eaten.  The Tuna in the sushi dinner was also very fishy smelling leaving me to believe that it was not fresh.   It was absolutely disgusting to me.  When I left, I even saw a new plate of sushi on a tray at waste level unattended and uncovered in the hallway where customers were walking next to it and almost right on top of it. That did not seem safe.  There were also to go orders scattered around the restaurant in site when I walked out.  It reminded me of a grocery store sushi business.Another ~ $9 roll only consisted of 3 small pieces, and it also was very poor tasting.  The salad hardly tasted Japanese at all.  It seemed just like leaves and oil... blah...  Other sushi was cut extremely small, and seemed blah bare minimum and uninspired... not nicely garnished like at some restaurants.  Yet, the fish itself also was underwhelming.  I had to ask for drink refills more than 3 times TWICE to get the refills I was seeking.   Almost everything was served slow and uncoordinated.  The restaurant also decided to do less for customers in ending the previous policy of offering a complimentary scoop of ice cream on somebodies birthday.  That seems really cheap, greedy, and not customer focused.  Meanwhile, the menu has been reduced and several decent dishes were eliminated.  It now seems to be a fusion or confusion restaurant concept that charges a lot but delivers so little...  It was so below the quality and creativity level of sushi and service I am used to, but also about the most expensive in town.  That is not fair to customers. I will definitely go elsewhere for better experiences.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

Got there on Saturday about an hour and forty-five minutes after opening, and the service was nonexistent and three quarters of the menu was not even available, as they had not prepped most of the food for the day, and they indicated most items would not be ready any time soon. There was no soap in the ladies bathroom, and we had to leave the restaurant twice while waiting for our food after our eyes were seriously burning and tearing while they prepared large quantities of onions with a complete lack of ventilation. It filled the whole place with noxious fumes.  Half the food we were able to order came cold and one dish was cold and completely soaked in thick oil / grease and totally disgusting.  I also had bad stomach trouble the night and day after the lunch there.

Blah...  Thumbs down on that dish all the way around.Most dishes are way too small and very ordinary in taste not getting passed the  ""so-so""  level.  The clams with noodles were much more tasty, but I sensed a likely salt and/or MSG overload going on.  That was not appreciated.  Also, the menu seems far too limited in terms of options for a place of this size.  I think this will limit business from non Chinese clientele, as too many of the menu options are too unfamiliar for most people, and comfort items are too far and few between even for more adventurous eaters.  The paper order slip on the table is generally annoying, but the servers do seem to sincerely try to make things right.  They are brand new so I forgive a key item (won ton soup) selling out at the start of dinner hour when hardly nobody was in the restaurant.However, I think this restaurant needs to get a lot more professional, raise the variety, portion size, and even quality of the foods.  Especially the fried spring rolls... They were a huge disappointment. Please be much better than other Chinese restaurants, not just another mediocre one...  I may give you one more chance this summer and if you can improve greatly, I'll raise my review.  If not, this is just another Chinese restaurant in the area falling short of expectations.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5908,"I get the impression The Customer Is Always Wrong here!  This is definitely no palace, and there was definitely no royal treatment going on here.A few weeks ago, I ordered delivery and although the food came late from the driver getting repetitively lost, and even though it was a little cold, I thought the food may still have enough potential to try again.I decided to try them again tonight.  It turned out to be a big mistake to do business with them.We picked up a simple  $15 order over there to bring home where I live in the next town.  It was a chicken breast meal and naan bread.  When I got home I discovered they used dark meat chicken in the dish instead of the grilled chicken breast I explicitly ordered and clarified 2 times to two different people on the phone (when I ordered), and that they also confirmed. I don't eat dark meat chicken, and last time they did give me white breast meat as requested, so I was very disappointed by their mistake tonight, when the meal arrived all the way home totally wrong.  It prevented me to eat dinner with the rest of my household who were eating other foods. No matter what, I was going to be eating dinner alone and late in a second shift, after everybody else was finished... because of this restaurant's mistake.  Nice way to spend Saturday night.  However, it kept getting worse.I called the restaurant back and after they acknowledged the issue and mistake on their end, I asked them to make it right to either deliver and exchange the right dish to me that I originally ordered or to credit my meal, because I did not want to make another round trip to the next town.  Things got complicated immediately.  I had to speak with two people.  I was then told nobody could deliver it and I would have to come back again to change the food (at my inconvenience mind you).  Then, I asked to just get a credit for the meal, as I lived fairly far away and it was not easy to make a second round trip there tonight.  After initially wasting my time and giving me the idea they would take care of me, they next ended the call with me and said they were too busy then, and they made me wait five minutes to call me back to discuss this further.  After they called back, I was already ordering food from another restaurant that would deliver to me. Therefore, I called them back when off the phone.  Instead of a simple credit for their mistake ($15), we had to discuss the whole issue again along with many pointless excuses in a very annoying drawn out manner.  You would have thought we were negotiating how to resolve an issue related to $15,000 and not $15.  I told them multiple times, I would come back again and forgive them if they made it right to me in a way that was acceptable to me.  No, they would not do that. It was their way or the highway (literally in this case).  They said I had to come back to their business to get my credit charge reversed and return the food, or it had to be my loss tonight and they would make it right next time if I came back, but I had to pay tonight, even though it was their mistake.  I did not agree with that at all.  If I paid money now, they did not give me what they originally confirmed I ordered, we already were out a full round trip of driving to the next town due to their mistake, and I definitely did not want to wait until a next time for them to make it right, for their mistakes today. They communicated that they were concerned I was trying to cheat them and eat that wrong food for free and still get my money back. This was very unprofessional, inappropriate, insulting, not customer focused, and poor business practice.    The bottom line is we both wasted a lot of time on the phone and they permanently lost a customer because it was too hard to either drive out to me to fix their mistake originally, or refund the $15 by a credit (even coming out to pick up the food later if they were so worried to get the food back as evidence to make sure they were not getting ""cheated"").  I told them I would gladly give them the whole order back, but with them picking it up, not making me go all the way back there.  They refused to do that.I soon realized what a waste of time it was dealing with them, and I threw the food in the garbage and ended my communications with them.  I will let them keep my money for the wasted and ruined dinner caused by them.  I hope holding onto the $15 so tightly was worth the permanent loss of my business.I wish I could give them zero stars on Yelp for terrible Customer Service...",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

Most dishes were nice and soups and appetizers were at a reasonable price point.  Dinners were definitely higher priced than most Chinatown restaurants. They just were not better.The clams in black bean sauce tasted very far from fresh, and they were a huge disappointment.  The clams were also overloaded with what appeared to be too much ground pork in the sauce.   The Hunan fish recipe was delicious but even under the mask of what was a nice recipe, the fish quality did not seem good enough, and I occasionally detected an older fishy taste when eating the dish... maybe there was also quite a bit of MSG / Sodium to hide the not so fresh fish taste I detected at times?You also need to watch out for the Pot Stickers.  They were served a little too soft and thick, with too much grease, oil, or fat oozing out to the plate, and that is not what I hoped for.  If that is what I wanted, I would order xiao long bao or soup dumplings.  Also, the meat in the pot stickers were not prepared carefully enough, as I tasted hard strange objects while I chewed them (that scares me about the meat quality inside).  That was really gross...If I lived close, I would perhaps go and try some other lunch specials, but it is hard to justify a special trip to the area just for that restaurant.    On the weekend, lunch for 2 can quickly set you back for $60 with tip, without any drinks.  It was Ok in some ways, but simply not that good to justify the trip.",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw

5944,"There is no way I would go back to this place, especially to protect my health.Who is rating this a 4 or 5 star restaurant?  Is the Vietnamese food in Charlotte that terrible?  This is the only Vietnamese Restaurant I have been to so far in Charlotte, but it was absolutely awful.  I don't live in this city, but I felt obligated as a good citizen to warn others about this extremely disappointing place.If you have any concern about the quality of food you eat, I would strongly recommend you avoid this restaurant at all costs.  I have been to Vietnamese restaurants all around the world (including Vietnam), and this is definitely on the bottom of the scale to me.When I walked into the restaurant my first impression was a very unappetizing rotten noxious smell filling the entire room.  Against my better judgment, I still stayed to try a few dishes, as I am  a food adventurer, and I falsely trusted some previous yelp reviews which were obviously very misleading to me.  Still, I take responsibility that I made a big mistake to stay at this restaurant.The environment was reasonable beyond the horrific smell, but the service was quite forgetful and not competent.  Communication in English was not easy, and I was not brought some of the things I ordered, like a glass of water I asked for twice... We are talking basics they can not perform here.  Some of the staff was more worried about eating their own meal in the same room when I dined there.  However, the worst part of the meal were the Fresh Spring Rolls with Shrimp and Chicken.  At first, the Chicken looked like nice strips of white chicken breast meat, but either it was spoiled, poorly prepared inconsistent with health department guidelines, or it was the cheapest and worst quality chicken on the market as it had such a terrible rotten and spoiled taste.  After a few bites, I was absolutely disgusted, and decided to stop eating, pay the check, and leave the restaurant.I did not feel well the rest of the day and evening.... and I could hardly eat anything else until the next day.  Not a good experience I would recommend for others.I think the people running the restaurant were nice people, but they really need to learn how to delivery quality service, how to invest in and prepare quality food, and most of all figure out a way to keep the restaurant from smelling like a sewer when customers walk in...  at least that is what it smelled like to me when I came there...I love Vietnamese food, and would love to see more quality Vietnamese food served in Charlotte and all over the country, but not at this poor quality level.  It is a not a good representation of Vietnamese Cuisine....",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5945,"Please be careful and beware of this place!!!  The multiple levels of management of this restaurant that I dealt with today is likely is the worst that I have experienced in the entire city and possibly the world. Today, I encountered such a complete breakdown of poor service there, that I could write a book on how many things were so poorly handled.   It was one extremely annoying mistake on top of another, and there was no ownership, empathy, or accountability from anyone.  It truly sucked being a customer of this restaurant. The ""manager"" on duty showed no ability to deal with customers and did nothing to improve my situation... and only walked away from me calling me a very nasty word in Spanish.  I had a terrible experience and sadly knew that I could not come back for at least a year or two after that (if ever at all).  Because I still wanted to give the restaurant owner a chance to know what happened for their own improvement opportunity, I tried to call who I was told to be the owner / top manager.  This is a person that only appears to be there some of the time.  I wanted to give him the courtesy to politely tell him what happened in great detail because I doubted his staff would convey to him the true horrible experiences I had. Instead of listening to anything I said so he could have an opportunity for improvement for other customers, he immediately and rudely interrupted me at the start of the conversation and hung on on me telling me to never come back to his restaurant again, in a hot headed, inpatient, angry, and ignorant way.  He must have listened to an incorrect version of what happened from his staff who I told I would call the owner.  However, he did not even give me a small chance to tell any of my side of the story before yelling at me and hanging up the phone on me.  It is a joke that a person like this is in the restaurant business.  Now I understand clearly that any communication with that restaurant is a totally waste of my time.I kind of saw that side of the same guy before when I witnessed him poorly deal with another customer at the cash register.  I know Customer Service because I have led Service Excellence initiatives for years in multi-national companies, and all I could see at this restaurant today is customer abuse, disrespect, and disregard.  I will gladly never go to this restaurant ever again just as requested by Joey.  It will be my privilege not to contribute a single cent of my money ever again to their business.  I frequently dine in restaurants all over this city and all over the world, and I have seldom seen anywhere such a pathetic way to run a business as I saw today in Highland Park.  All of my dining and everyone I dine with will be going to the competition now, as I have never seen a Deli around here ran as poorly as I saw today in Highland Park.  The only thing I would rate high at Max's deli is their outstanding ability to drive a previously loyal customer away for good.  In that way, they are legendary!!!  It is quite a surprising business strategy that I just can not understand....I have read numerous complaints in different media about how this restaurant's management mistreats customers.  I can see now that feedback was likely totally correct.  When multiple people complain about the same problem, maybe it is not the customers and perhaps the restaurant that is the problem???No deli food is worth the rock bottom customer service and disregard I experienced today... gladly finished and done with this place!",PUTDPPO7hEICLQDEGSRBhw
5949,"The food was OK. Nothing special. The service was awful, like something I would expect on TV. No one greeted us. Then someone from the kitchen shouted at us asking if we had a reservation. We didn't. He grumbled to sit down. The restaurant was mostly empty. We got eyes rolled at us when we didn't order any drinks. The server seemed like she might walk away right then rather than take our food order. She never checked back in. Only came back after other people had brought our food. I have her my card and she seemed annoyed again that I didn't even want to consider dessert. When she bright back my card, she literally tossed the check register across the table and walked away without a word. I started laughing out loud. I've never had someone be so rude in the service industry. The whole place didn't want us there it seemed, and she enough, I'll never go back.",AZnc8d0U87z8klVs9r_mMw
5951,Service is terrible. Had a table of 6. Food came out sporadically. Server would walk off after we ordered only to come back 20 minutes later to say something was 86'd. Didn't put in this we asked for and acted like it was our fault. Food wasn't even very good. Mac n cheese was boring and flavorless. Chips had no salt. Enchiladas (cinco de mayo special) were more Indian in flavor than Mexican. No bueno.,AZnc8d0U87z8klVs9r_mMw
5952,"The only reason they got stars was for service. Service was a solid 4.5 stars (good job Mark), but I'm reviewing the food. Always used to go the bridge at its old location and the atmosphere and menu were great. More personable. Elvis burger was a win.... Tried to be regulars still when they moved to Morgan Junction, but the food quality has just been plummeting. One party member had the peppercorn steak - awful. I didn't know you could screw up a sauce/steak like that. Bison burger was OK but nothing great. Bbq chicken tasted like spicy ketchup and the tacos were blah. Bring back the old Bridge.",AZnc8d0U87z8klVs9r_mMw
5953,"I expect more from a four star location. The ambiance was generic and felt like a chain restaurant not to mention the paper table covers.... The food was bland and unimaginative. Had the crab cakes which were terrible and the fettuccine, which tasted like a lean cuisine. I'd rather go to olive garden.",AZnc8d0U87z8klVs9r_mMw
6005,"Terrible experience here with the service department. I don't usually go to dealerships because they're notorious for charging an arm and a leg. I went because I received a recall notice for 1 product. First time I called, they didn't have the product and recommended a timeline to call back. I called back and scheduled an appointment. The notice said the repair would take no more than 1 hour. I parked my car in the service area and getting help took a while. I was told the waiting area was upstairs. I went all the way upstairs and was in some area with random boxes. Apparently it was only a few stairs up where they sell cars. I figured this out eventually, whatever, my fault. At this point, I've waited 1.5 hours with no update about the timeline. I ask the service desk staff and they state I had 2 recall repairs. This was never communicated to me. They state it will be 20 more minutes. 30 minutes later, my car is ready. They offer me 3 or 4 basic car washes at Brown Bear so I'm not too upset, I'm just happy to move on to my next set of errands. A couple months later, I called the service desk to ask a question, was transferred 2x and still didn't get an answer to my question. I live about 5 miles away but if I need a Hyundai dealer again, I'd rather try the Kirkland or Auburn ones. Avoid.",VpbfazUJdbTf7BtvTiq0nQ
6009,"I came here 2 years ago and didn't love it so I only came here today with a friend because it was near where we were going to have dinner. We only waited a couple minutes. However, their color selection for a regular manicure is limited. My manicurist didn't completely remove the previous color I had on, as I can see the blue-purple in the corners of the hot pink I chose. While cleaning up my nails, she ended up piercing too much skin and caused bleeding. She cleaned it up and put rubbing alcohol to manage the blood but she didn't apologize or prompt me. There was no indication that their materials were sterile, as other salons will have these materials in a sealed bag for every customer. The massage was short-lived and the manicurist took off my watch and smudged her lotion all over it. On top of that, the painting doesn't look sharp and there are some imperfections. They have a sign requesting cash only tips, which is just tacky. They will add it to your debit card if you specify your tip amount. Lastly $15 is a bit much for a simple manicure. Update: It's only been 3 days (off work) and several nails have started to chip.",VpbfazUJdbTf7BtvTiq0nQ

Next time I went, I made an appointment online since I was on a time crunch and they had a discount for online appointments. I arrived and they seemed confused about the online reservation. I told them I needed my gel to be done by a certain time and they assured me it would be. Time comes for me to leave and my nails are not dry. In fact, it's chipped. On top of this, they charge me $5 more than the advertised price and when I ask about it, a staff member blows it off. At this point, I'm visibly frustrated and in a rush to leave because I'm late to a special event. The same staff member offers to give me cash back for the wrong charge but I refuse because not only am I late but I see how they try to cheat their customers and do not honor their prices until they're addressed.",VpbfazUJdbTf7BtvTiq0nQ

No customer service skills whatsoever.I asked for a simple 1 inch trim/cut with layers. Front looks ok. I look at the back and I'm horrified at how blunted the layers look. Completely unflattering when the longest layer is a complete inch longer than the shortest.

6177,"I was the Third Paitent of Dr. Hansen and his old partner Dr. Allderidge.  Back in 2002. I have had my lap band for 15 years. I suspect my band has slipped or is eroding into my stomach. My gastroenterologist in Washington State is doing an upper GI next week. But he wants my Lap Band Emptied before he does the procedure. I had to fly down to Utah so I started calling as soon as I booked my flight. Needless to say I was not impressed with the staff.  Now...I haven't been able to eat solids since February 19th of this year, I can't keep anything in. Everytime I do eat I am puking all my food up. I have developed in the last two years acid reflux that is painful and I can't sleep. This office dosen't care. They couldn't care less. They just take your money. When Dr. Allderidge retired I had to pay $500 to be treated and I paid $300 to get fills/ adjustments for the year. Well I paid the $300 and shortly after that had to leave the state. I do not mind the transfer fee but I would like the times and office hours posted someplace easily accessible. I am back the Fill Nurse is on Vacation but they have no one to cover her which is rediculious. So hope if you get a lap band from this office that you never have an ""Emergency"" when she is out because it will cost you another $50.00 on top of what you have already paid. Even though I called for this appointment weeks ago. It is considered an emergency because the Nurse is on Vacation. That is poor customer service. After I get this band loosened if my upper GI confirms what I suspect is going on I will get it removed. Because I am sick of throwing up and acid reflux. I no longer live in Utah but if you are considering the lap band... consider another doctor that actually will treat you like a patient not a paycheck. Bedside manner is very important. Needless to say, I don't feel that from this office. I am transferring my care to an office in Washington. It is sad after 15 years that I feel this way.  *****Update to Review****  for transfer patients who had to switch Doctors post the schedule on your web page and update it when your nurse goes on vacation.

Then when we got to the window and paid it was only 4 minutes after we paid we were told they were out of soup and had to make more.  So instead of blocking up the line I suggested that I drive to the front door so they could help the three other cars behind me.  While waiting for soup the three other cars got service. Glad I suggested that to avoid more pissed off customers. Then they brought our food to our car with a halfassed sorry and ran off.

Sadly our pizzas arrived anyone was cut in half not regular and the one for the kids was cut so poorly that you still had to rip it apart. Had just one slice of the spinach Alfredo chicken cordon bleu pizza that we ordered we all said it tasted funky and now I myself and sicker than a dog and the other people are having intestinal pain. I emailed the corporate office have yet to receive a response I doubt I will but the pizza we ordered today was not good and I don't think I'll be ordering from Papa Johns again. I would rather go to Pizza Hut or dominos and know that my pizza not going to have a sour funky spinach Alfredo that tastes like it's been out of the fridge for more than a week.

So I always take my very large commission checks to this location every single time I do they tell me they have to put it on a hold period when none of my commission checks have ever found ever in the past and I even asked him to notice on the account every single time this happens. I am seriously ready to go to another bank because this one location makes my banking experience terrible,HoikILIsY79TWCf62ecKQA

6277,Shorter menu. I feel like I am reading the bible. Too many choices. Do one thing right. I like the avocado spring rolls and the shrimp scampi. The chicken Madeira is good but honestly the portions ate huge and I can never finish even half my meal. I am always too full to order cheesecake.

6286,I don't get what people think is so great about this place. It's mediocre at best. Its just like any other breakfast cafe in Utah you can get the same stuff it and is cafe at the Olympus cafe there's nothing different or unique about Sharon's cafe unless you consider griny dingy miss mosh pit tables and chairs. I got the eggs benedict with the shredded potatoes I asked him to be cooked crunchy they did an excellent job with that however the hollandaise sauce tasted like it was from McCormick's hollandaise sauce packets that you can make it home it didn't taste homemade. My husband and I tried something diffrent. We usually go to the lazy day cafe in Mill Creek I know why we continue to go to the lazy day cafe because they have something unique and different every weekend for their specials and their breakfast menu is one to die for they have different flares for everything and everything is definitely homemade. If I wanted Country Crock I'd go to the store and buy it myself but I prefer to have real butter and good food that I don't have to cook myself honestly I could do better than Sharon's cafe,HoikILIsY79TWCf62ecKQA

I went to take out the stopper in the lid and the lid came off and the drink splashed all over my car and half of it was in my drink holder in the console and on the floor and seat and my leg.  I would rather DRIVE to the Sapp Brothers Beans and Brews park my car and walk inside. The girl who is there is Quick, kind and so much nicer.  I do not think I will be back to this location EVER.",HoikILIsY79TWCf62ecKQA
6297,I never noticed this place before so I decided to drop in and get a to go order. It was ready in less than 5 minutes.  While I waited I checked out the Decor. Standard but OLD and Dated. But with most Mexican Restaurants in the Salt Lake Area that is standard fare.  I always get a Chili Rellenos to compare my food at every establishment.  IT was good nothing to write home about. The stem was still on it. Which WHY do they do that. No one eats it. So it is a waste of plate space.  The beans were made with lard and had flavor and I appreciate that.  I did not have the rice because I never eat rice.  I will probably go back. But only if I am not in the mood to drive to my favorite place.,HoikILIsY79TWCf62ecKQA
6304,"It says it is under renovation, however I have not seen any changes from the last time I was here two years ago. (I know, i should have learned my lesson)The rooms are outdated, old and run down. Our wallpaper was peeling and the window was so smeary and dirty that we kept the holey blackout curtains closed. The desk chair was completely broken and if you sat in it it would shoot all the way back, as if you were laying down. (To be fair, when I reported the broken chair they did discount the bill). The restaurant and lounge has closed. All of the carpets are torn and tattered. And the pool, wow! It's in the old Holiday Inn style building that has a lanai covered in AstroTurf. Except it was last maintained when Chevy Chase stayed there in National Lampoons Vacation. It is trashed. Parts of the ceiling are hanging down. The water was ice cold. No hot tub. Plus the fitness center is in an abandoned guest room. The breakfast was the usual free buffet, not bad, not good. If you're looking for a good cheap night in Ellensburg this is not it. It's so bad it's almost funny. Almost.",MRV6ZkVAGJvhwF7c9vTTKg
6307,"First of all, the doctor was very nice, kind and compassionate. They all truly seem to care about animals, and were gentle with my cat. One star. The price is reasonable. One star. The reason for only two stars (and I'm being generous) is because my cat was sicker than what they could handle there and he was given antibiotics without any real diagnosis. His blood work was ok, just low white blood count ""maybe"" an infection. Let's start with antibiotics and an appetite stimulant. Here's the number for the Vet Hospital (Blue Pearl on Aurora 5) if he gets worse. I was told that I could take him there right away if I wanted to, but who doesn't hold onto hope of a simple antibiotic could resolve the issue? 36 hours later we had to Euthanize our pet at the animal hospital. He had almost every symptom of a brain tumor. The hospital folks seemwhen I told them what was prescribed there. I'm not a vet. You are. I wish that if you don't know you don't grasp at straws and just immediately admit that there are better places to help my poor cat. I trusted your advice. We suffered through 36 hours of hell. Rest In Peace Charlie.  Don't go here if your pet is sick. I'm sure it's fine for routine maintenance or spay/neuter. Guess what lady. If you had told me to get to the hospital immediately I would have! I love my cats. They are family. You gave crappy advice in an effort as it seems to Sell expensive antibiotics. Your advice was bad. DON'T GO HERE! Do spend the extra money and take your pet to Blue Pearl. They actually care and know how to help your pet.

We have been coming here for five years. We walk in and every time it's the Seattle freeze (which I don't even believe in!). We order drinks and food and we are both industry and know how to treat a person right,  but can't break through. My soup comes with crunchy navy beans. We make total eye contact 6-8 times. Flagged her down. Still no service. Ten whole minutes in a bar with six other folks she comes back. I say it's crunchy and she merely takes it away. No apology. No asking if I'd like something else.

When the guy in charge of that called me (see, they do have my phone number, funny that they didn't call ME when my flowers couldn't be delivered...) he agreed to refund minus their $14.99 fee. Because it was my fault that I didn't provide the apartment number. I was fine with the redelivery the next day. But my mom never got the flowers. So I paid $14.99 for a big hassle and no flowers. No stars.Edit: Monday morning a very nice person called and refunded my $14.99. It is nice, but too late to change my opinion of this company. Still- no stars.

He was yelling at his medical assistants in the hallway when he wasn't talking on his cell. There is dirt, blood etc. on the floor (see the photos!). The sink was full of bloody instruments from the last procedure. The chair was cracked and the foam lining has a red/brown splotch. The med tech was running around and rolling her eyes. The Dr. was answering his personal cell phone and yakking for 15 minutes while I was in agony waiting for him to bandage my poorly executed stitches. Please, just glue your wound shut and save yourself the humiliation of this place. I filleted my index fingertip with a razorblade, 1/4 inch deep and 1"" long.

The man in the waiting room with the similar finger injury was happily taking his pain meds, I asked him!

6347,"The staff member there was friendly, but my experience was pretty bad.The one poor server had to deal with both the retail part of the store and the bar, so he kept popping from one side of the shop to the other.  I was the only person in the bar side asking for beer, and it took over ten minutes for me to get it.  Again, I was the only person at the counter requesting a beer.The ciders I had here were quite good, but only one of the beers tasted good at all.  I am a huge fan of IPAs, NEIPAs, and DIPAs, but one I had here tasted like literal soap (apparently some people think all IPAs taste soapy, but that is absolutely NOT the case for me and surprised me when I learned it).  The stout I had tasted very watery.  My last drink was a cider; the server poured me a completely different one than the one I requested.  I was fine with either so went with it, but it was still a surprising mistake.Food options were limited because of equipment problems and limited supply.  The $8 pizza was tiny for that size (authentic Neapolitan pizzerias on Greenwood have larger pizzas for cheaper), and while the BBQ and garlic ranch dipping sauces for the fries were quite good, the $6 price point was too high for a medium quantity of fries.I like the idea of this place and would be willing to come back if the management sorts out the apparent staffing shortages.",xZmhLUQOVw9KJX5w6A9BvQ

I know things were going to go badly when I saw the fried rice was taken out from a bowl on the counter, but at least the meat was freshly cut. They also offered to reheat it is up with a microwave for me which is kind of insane that they don't have it hot.As for the food, it was meat were eatable, but bland.

The place wasn't empty, but it wasn't bustling either, so we gave it a shot. The menu seemed promising. K got the tuna tartare tacos and I decided chopped salad. The tacos came in three and were tiny. And K said they were ok. The chopped salad was more like cubed salad. And it was just vegetables cubed and tossed with dressing, no lettuce/spring mix/arugula/etc. Really mediocre food. We decided, ok let's try one more thing. So we tried the duck confit nachos. Bad idea. It's just a weird queso dip, topped with a few pieces of duck confit (if you can even call it that) in a ramekin with stale chips around it. Overall, pretty disappointed by the food.

6623,"I came here a couple of years ago for either Seattle Restaurant Week or Dine Around Seattle and had I reviewed them then, I probably would have given them 3.5-4 stars.  The food was good, the waitstaff was friendly, and the wait time was reasonable.However, fast forward to this past Mother's Day and the only constant was the friendly waitstaff.  I made reservations for Mother's Day brunch, which means breakfast and lunch menu items (right?!).  Instead, they did a special menu serving just breakfast.  We ordered beignets to start.  First of all, just because it's fried dough doesn't mean it's a beignet.  Beignets should be light and airy and these were heavy.  They tasted fine, but it's not a beignet.  About 30 minutes after the beignets, we got the rest of our food...it's freaking breakfast food!  It shouldn't take that long!  My sister and I both got a benedict of some sort and when you put your fork into that yolk...it should ooze beautifully.  Should being the key word.  I put my fork into it and it was stuck in there.  The egg was so overcooked!  Hard boiled egg on a muffin!  If you're advertising that all you're doing is breakfast food? You better do it right!  How hard is it to poach a freaking egg?  Especially if that's ALL YOU'RE DOING.  My dad got the steak and eggs and his steak was overcooked (he asked for medium) and over easy egg came over hard (big surprise there).  I did tell a waitress about the problem and she promptly sent over our waiter and I told him the problem for the benny's and he offered to redo our benny's, but seeing how everything took so long, I just asked for new eggs.  So he brought us new eggs.  This time they were a bit under (you could see that the whites weren't fully cooked)- but I didn't want to have to deal with the issue anymore.  My dad, disappointed with what he had, just ate it because he knew it would take too long to redo his.Overall, it was a pretty disappointing brunch to celebrate mom.  The food wasn't great, the wait time was ridiculous (it wasn't super busy when we went), but at least the wait staff was decent.",h59iX3YOfP1laPF000BV0Q

I grew up in Spanaway and used to eat here in the 90s when they still had smoking sections and the big plastic toy bin for kids to grab a treat.Usually my visits back are fine but today was below sub-par.The host sat us immediately so that was great however he was really rushy and I truly probably do contribute that to him believing his mannerisms=efficiency. Before my daughter was even through the door he said table for 2? Yes, right this way!And before we were even in our seats or sat down he asked us what we wanted to drink.

It got good reviews on yelp so I decided to try it. In short I would not recommend. Im sorry I can't describe the taste but i didn't like it. Maybe it was too flour-Y.My kid liked her food just fine. But the waitress brought us the bill right after the food and it's counter pay service so she didn't check on us. Not until it was time to go and by that time I had no desire to PAck up my daughter's food anymore.The prices are good.

I have raved about their CFS omlette and I get it everytime. I think they have a new cook because today's was a serious disappointment. The hashbrowns were also total mush.

There was not even anyone else waiting in the area to be seated besides myself.Our server was fine and attentive but as your experience starts when you walk through the door this is not one I would like to relieve.Luckily there are plenty of other restaurants to eat at in the town center that will be more friendly and accommodating.And their fries will probably not be hard and overcooked.

6688,"I hate to write poor reviews but I also hate people being fooled into thinking a place is great based off of a couple of positive reviews as I was after yelping businesses to get an idea of their services. I am an avid reviewer I use yelp for everything. Writing my own reviews as well as looking for places to visit based off of customer reviews. I was unhappy with the new technique my lash Esthetician was using on me and the result of my lashes after a few days of having them on. I researched extensively for a lash spa that I would trust to do my lashes. One that had good reviews and good pictures of their work. Eventually after my first choice and I kept having scheduling conflicts I settled for crown beauty lounge their photos looked good and their place of business looked quaint and clean too. I had Jenna as my lash artist and it was the weirdest most impersonal appointment I have ever been too. It's an oversized room with a bed, downtown in Tacoma. It was a cute and clean room but there was no music and no sign of a warm welcome. She was nice enough but I swear she literally said less than 10 words to me. I think she was sick too because she kept sniffling and she sounded congested so maybe that's why she wasn't social and talkative but they should at least play some music in the background for a two hour appointment. Even elevators you're riding for two floors have music playing. Oh and about the two hour appointment time - it wasn't. I came in for a full dramatic set but only received about 1 hour and 10 minutes of work and really sparse lashes. I said wow you did that really quick ! She said yeah it's not really a 2 hour set, but it was. And that's what I paid for. Whatever though sometimes I like wispy lashes - like when I'm in need of my2 week fill. I paid her and she didn't even ask to rebook me, who doesn't try to rebook their clients for retention on an appointment that's going to be reoccurring like lash extensions???? I tipped her and left with my natural looking lashes, obviously they were more beautiful than my own lashes but they were not what I was hoping for. To make matters worse when I looked closely I could see that lashes were turned the wrong ways and there was a lash extension glued to more than one natural lash. Which Is a huge no no. The extra star is for the owner, whose name I cannot recall , But she was quick to answer my questions and get back to me via social media when I asked her the brand and products that were used during the appointment since Jenna never answered me back on social media. There are probably some lash artists, like the owner , who are great at lash application and client retention and relationship but I would avoid making an appointment with Jenna for now.",MVb93PtUPbSsVFa-3prvcg

However my review is truthful as I am not the only potential client they have ignored regarding receiving appointments. Wish I could leave a review about this place but I can't get an answer back from anyone regarding their lashes which is ironic because they have been posting and advertising about it on all social media platforms and are even running a special for it this month. Sets are beautiful and prices are really low in comparison to what's around Tacoma especially for what looks like such great work (despite one yelp user saying hers don't stay on even though she's followed all aftercare routine to take care of them) but no one will reach back out to me regarding the questions I have about the product they use. Reading prior reviews it looks like I am not the only one who gets ignored and unfortunately I'll have to take my lash business elsewhere.

Presentation was lovely as you can see by my pictures but it was not very good. The eggs were cooked through which was so saddening the yolk was hard and stiff.

We had heard they had great meat - sausage and bacon and unfortunately neither were tasty or cooked well :( Pros : the neighborhood and view is beautiful cute quaint and welcoming.

I came here right after they opened for dinner on a week night so it was not very busy. No one at the hibachi tables and only two tables filled with other customers. I was quickly sat with my 1 year old son. Ordered my food and drink. Drink never came which is fine because soda pops not good for you anyways so I just had my water. Well in killing time and waiting for our food I let my son who was sitting in his high chair have the soup spoon and chopstick to play with. When a woman, not my waitress came by she took the chop sticks from my son claiming they were dangerous. As if as his mother I wasn't sitting next to him paying attention. I said oh he's fine , and she took them anyways. I was ready for the check after my mediocre meal, she brought me my check and I gave her my card immediately (again NOT my waitress but the woman who came and took the chopstick). She was gone for 12 minutes with my debit card and that made me uncomfortable because it never takes that Long for them to swipe a card and tear a receipt slip off and bring it to you. She made me feel like she was compromising my card info I don't know recording it down or taking a picture of it or something. Because like I said it wasn't busy in there so I don't know what the hold up was. I just wanted my card and to get out of there as soon as possible. Whether or not she compromised my card isn't the point the point is it is unethical and questionable when you are stranger gone that long with someone's card.

6715,"Update : KIM did my nails more perfect than they've ever been done. I will request her everytime. They look sooooo good !! They are short perfect shaped and even. She totally redeemed them. The only reason why I didn't give them 5 stars is because when my daughter got her nails painted , Kim didn't remove her old polish she just painted over it. It looks fine and my daughter loves her little nails but I think they should remove old polish before applying new coats. Kim is my girl!! Original review : So I'm going to start out by giving this place 2 stars but I will go back for redemption in hopes to increase their solar star rating. Anyways, let me start by saying I haven't had acrylic nails for about 8 years. They're spendy, I always would pick them off, I get anxiety when their tools are near me for fear of bad sanitation and cutting me (it has happened too many times I don't know know why!) I tried shellac a few times and it was ok, it made my nails look nice, but they would always chip at the base/cuticle and snag my hair when I would wash it in the shower and then I would just pick them off and be left with sore finger nails. And polishing my nails traditionally now a days is a feat I can't accomplish with a 6 month old plus he likes to suck on everything including my fingers so chipping polish is no good ! But I HATE having unpainted fingernails, I like them super short and cute. Soooo enter the revival of acrylics and my review of VNails: many of my coworkers have gone to VNails or still go there and recommendations are one of the best ways to find something (hello, Yelp) not to mention they're a mile from my house so it was convenient and it doesn't get bad reviews , for the most part. So I walk in with my 4 year old daughter and I cannot believe how packed it is although I shouldn't be surprised since it's a Sunday (this is rare of a nail place! Kudo!) so I almost immediately walk back out but they assure me they will get us right in. We wait for about 15 minutes or so. It's not that bad. They have like 10 pedicure chairs and 10 maybe 8 manicure chairs, the place is huge. Every seat sat a butt. After the wait we were brought to two chairs and we sat. And waited some more. Then she sat down and started on me. She was nice. She was not rough but she was super rushy. Oh after we sat down like 6 more people came in. So I get it. I told her what I wanted and that my daughter wanted hot pink nails with a flower on her thumb. I told her i didn't have acrylics for a long time and I wanted them to look as natural as possible. She cut them short which I like, I wish she would have filed them shorter though. And when she asked what shape I said natural , square - round. She did my right pinky first and it was PERFECT! And that's what I told her. But then she did all the other nails more squared. Which I don't like- but at least they aren't sharp. The acrylic is too thick it doesn't look natural enough. And a few of my nails are different lengths then it's opposite on the other hand, and mis-shaped. I chalk this up to just her rushy-ness though. I even told her I didn't want my cuticles trimmed so that saved her time, but not time she was putting into my fingers. The whole time I'm getting my nails done my daughter is just sitting next to me waiting. I don't know why 4-5 other ladies got started on before her. She was still receiving a service that I was paying for and it was a service that didn't take more than 10 minutes. But she had to wait until she was finished with mine and then the same gal started on hers. She sort of ruined the experience of us getting our nails done together. So the low rating is for uneven nails, an unprofessional paint job (it's uneven), the rushing and the order in which customers are Helped. When I go back in a week or two for a fill I will tell them I don't like the shape. And come in early during the week in hopes they can redeem themselves. I again will not have them trim my cuticles because i did not see her take her tools out of any type of sanitary storage there was actually nail dust and remnants all over her box.",MVb93PtUPbSsVFa-3prvcg
6722,"I wanted to give this place more stars just for being a vegan restaurant but I couldn't. I'm not a vegan per se , I still eat meat, but i have a MSPI and gluten free diet because of my breastfeeding son so usually my best bets to eat out at a vegan spot if there is one. Unfortunately i only know of 2 in Tacoma-quickie too and viva. When I get there with my MIL and we take a look at the menu I see that 99% of the menu uses soy as its dairy and ""meat"" alternatives so I only have two options : soup and house salad or the mama Africa burger or wrap. I was excited to dry the mama Africa burger and was glad there was something on the menu I could get. After taking 10 minutes to come by and take our order, and another 10' to bring us our drinks, our very much dazed out server / host/ busser came by to tell me they were all out of the mama Africa mix (which didn't make sense to me because it was 12:45 and they had just opened at 11) and he recommended I just get the salad soup and fries since my diet is pretty tight. I did and it tasted good, the fries especially. The agave lemonade was really yummy. So I guess the lacking stars in this review is because of the service (I won't be offensive) and the lack of options for something that doesn't contain soy. I've been to viva 4x and gotten something different each time, all dishes they were able to alter to accommodate my soy intolerance OR they didn't use the overused substitute of soy period. Also everything at viva is GF and Quickie Too only has some GF options. I probably won't be back to dry that mama Africa",MVb93PtUPbSsVFa-3prvcg
6726,"So I'm torn writing this review because I really do love the food here at Shakabrah as well as the ambience. But today I went in there at 2:35 on a Sunday (their hours are the same all week, as well as posted on the doors) and was greeted by a tired server who wanted to let me know that the kitchen was closed. They advertise they are open until 4pm and they also post that the kitchen closes at 3pm everyday. So it doesn't make sense to me that when I come in 25 minutes before the kitchen closes and nearly an hour and half before the establishment closes you tell me I've missed the food boat. It's not logical nor kind to post a serving window but not hold true to that. I think it's a bad practice and they either need to let us know by updating their signage that the kitchen isn't actually open till 3 as we are led to believe or they good practice good business skills and actually BE open and ready to make food until 3. My waiters have always been nice here and my vegetarian scramble has always been delicious I love that they have a full coffee bar. But effective today I am on a mini boycott from this place because today's attempt to eat was a fail and has left a bad taste in my mouth. Sorry guys and you should be too.",MVb93PtUPbSsVFa-3prvcg
6729,"Don't take your car here ! For anything !!! I drive a 99 volvo and one day it decided to shit out on me in more than one way. I work part time and am a student too. I needed a slew of things done and every place wanted to charge me a ridiculous labor fee just to install my alternator that I had already purchased on my own to have put in. Kevin at buckys gave me the lowest price. Well when I got there they said there was a tear and rip on my radiator and it was $800 to fix I couldn't believe it. That part of my car was fine before I brought it in and the two other places that looked At it before buckys didn't say anything about a radiator leak. I took it to Firestone across the street they ran some tests and there were no leaks. Kevin and shithead mechanic at buckys were just trying to take advantage of a little unknowing girl with her two year old daughter. Incredibly rude. So This is 4 months ago in August. Two weeks ago I'm running errands driving my car and I keep smelling something burning. I open my hood and there is a TOOL that buckys left in my engine who's plastic blue handle is melting onto the hot and heated metal something in my car !!! (Unknowing like I said , I have no idea what it was melting on to) but seriously !!! You lied to me about work needing to be done. Kevin you showed me on Google images what part of my radiator was ripped but couldn't show me where on my own car it was. And you left a freakin tool under my hood for 3 months probably jammed up with my alternator that u installed and it finally rattled out after 500 miles of driving only to have its cheap blue handle melted and smothered all over a hot piece of my engine carriage ! You guys are a-holes and it's not ever worth saving a few bucks to go here. Never. The fact that you aren't responsible and leave tools in people's brain of their car really took the cake.

6730,"I looooove forZa. Let me rephrase that I LOOVEEE the forza on pearl st in Westgate. I also love UP.  But this forZa location in UP on 27th is the worst. I am incredibly loyal to forza- it all started when they started using GMO free Milk products- Whoo hoo!!! But the girls at 27th in UP cannot figure out how to make an iced white chocolate Americano effectively. I've given them multiple chances I've had different baristas but for some reason they are not trained consistently nor effectively in the art of making one of the most simple and popular drinks. I lived off 27th four and a half years ago and that former staff could make it just fine, it's where I fell in love with the white iced americanos at, but the 4 times I've been there in the last month or two have literally left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Last Sunday I went it was disgusting. I went to starbucks to get my caffeine thrill and it was almost as bad as the Americano from this forza. After studying for 4 hours I then just stopped by the one In WG by my house. The coffee bar of the heavens. No one makes drinks better than the girls at the pearl st location. I know forzas are franchised but it's too bad they couldn't just train all their employees to make beverages in a correct and tasty manner at all locations.",MVb93PtUPbSsVFa-3prvcg
6738,"Let me be clear in that I am giving the salon 1 star for just their waxing services by someone named TJ. If I was rating hair I would give them at least 4 stars but that's not what this review is for. I've gotten my hair cut there and was happy with the services both times by Brittany and Megan. I would go back to them. Last night I decided to go get my nice, full, thick brows CLEANED UP. NOT mis-shaped, not thinner and NOT waxed fully off- which is what I left with!!! I have not had such a terrible wax job since the 11th grade at an asian nail salon, thanks a lot for ruining that TJ. What makes me the most upset is that I went in there and told her how skeptical I was about their waxing services because I had never been there, I spent 5 minutes telling her exactly what I did not want her to do and all the problems that have happened before at the thai and vietnamese salons, and what did she do? RUINED MY FACE. My eyebrows DO NOT match, they are the worst wax job I have ever seen and they are shaped like a frown!

I was disappointed when they didn't have the cucumber kimchi but the daikon radish kimchi was okay. All the other toppings were alright.  Given it was my first time here, it's too bad they don't offer us to try the sauces. It would have been easier to enjoy if I knew what sauces I was getting. Final note. I was disappointed with was the loud  KPop music that didn't represent the Hawaiian culture.  I may try other places that are more authentic and that is not a wannabe poke establishment.",pQTfm_oUSiHp8-l0ZaEb-w
6751,"Literally the worst ever. I preordered on my walk to Starbucks and ordered a trenta pineapple black tea lemonade. The recipe has pineapple fusion, black tea and lemonade. The sweetener includes 7 pumps of cane sugar. When I arrived at Starbucks the first thing I noticed was the color. The drink was darker than usually. I took a sip and didn't taste any lemonade. Whomever made my order didn't read what I had ordered. It was without the lemonade and any of the original sweetener. The only thing they got right was the 2 extra packets of raw sugar. I told the barista that there was no lemonade and he made it with no questions asked. A customer came in and then he handed my drink off to someone else. The other barista then continued to make my drink again. They handed me my drink and I took another sip. Only this time the sweetener was left out. At this point, it going 20 mins into making my order correctly. What is going on?!?  Why can't they get my order correct? Eventually after the 3rd time, it was made like its suppose to be made.

6771,"Bottom line: Don't come here if you've been to Texas for real Texas brisket. I read about this place in a Seattle Times article saying that this was the Seahawks favorite BBQ place and that the owner takes his brisket very seriously. Food & Wine recently named this the best BBQ in the state. Are we even eating the same brisket here?? Having recently traveled to Austin and sampled 4 of the top brisket places there I had high expectations. And this place fell short in every aspect. 1. The brisket was dry as hell. If you look closely at my photo, I got 1 pound of brisket so I had 5 slices between the two of us. Only 2 of the slices had a small fat cap, the rest had none and there was no fat throughout the brisket. The brisket had no smoke flavor despite this imported oak from Texas. The brisket was so dry because there was no fat there to begin with.The places I went to in Austin were using USDA Prime for their brisket so there was a fat cap and fat throughout the brisket which made for tender and flavorful meat. For the quality, Jeff's is overpriced. We had to dunk each bite of meat in sauce to choke it down. My friend even went back for more sauce. 2. Meat didn't seem fresh. The meat is not visible to you when you order and is hiding in a warmer in the corner so I don't know if it was precut and just drying out. At places I went to in Austin, I was able to see the meat and watch them take a whole brisket and slice off my requested portion size.3. The spicy and original sauces were indistinguishable. No kick to the spicy sauce and the original was bland and might as well have come from a bottle. Given the sign that bragged about homemade sauces, I expected more. 4. Pickles, onions and bread. Standard white bread, nothing special. Pickles were overly salty. I normally like picked things and these were not good. I prefer onions in slices vs chunks because it's not like I'm putting these on top of a hot dog. After we had finished eating, this guy that I later realized was the owner came by to ask how the food was. I hesitated for a moment and then just said it was fine. One opinion isn't going to change anything. Getting a refund isn't going to make the experience better. The food will continue to be prepared in the same way. After wishing I had said something, later that evening I left an unhappy face on my Square receipt survey with an explanation and got a reply from the owner. He said they're not perfect and that he would have tried to fix it. Looking at previous photos, this is just the level of his brisket. He said he started the smoker at 315am but as other reviews have said, there's no smoke flavor. I may be in the minority here but this place is not worth the hype. Verdict: Don't drive up from Seattle like we did to try this place out. You'll end up feeling sorry for yourself and need to find another meal to erase the memory of this place.",aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g
6774,"3rd time is not a charm.We went to celebrate today and splurged on the $65 per person Omakase and what we got was laughable. It was nowhere near what I was expecting. I had looked at lots of photos of the Omakase beforehand and people said the fish was fresh and the cuts thick. We experienced neither. The fish was cut so thinly you could see the shiso leaf through a piece of salmon. See photo and note the dark areas on the nigiri. That's just embarrassing Miyabi.What happened here? We got 18 pieces including the egg that were about 50% smaller and thinner than the other nigiri that I saw them making. So if people spend more, they get more variety of but tiny pieces?Don't do the Omakase here. You will get better fish by ordering nigiri on it's own. I also told the server about the rotten and bitter uni that we both had and she did nothing about it. She said she would tell the chef but I didn't see her doing that either. Uni is delicious in sushi and sweet and creamy and to finish our meal on an bitter note made for a lackluster celebration. I've had uni on so many occasions and never tasted something so foul. This should never have been served to a paying customer. If I get sick, I know it was the fish here.I've given this place 3 chances and their quality is not up to par. I'm never wasting more money on them again.Update: This is later the same night. My stomach is experiencing some symptoms.",aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g

6787,"This is the 2nd funeral I've attended in the past year for my grandparents and the funeral director Holly at Lincoln Memorial was the most unprofessional and rude person I have had to work with. These are my 3 negative interactions with her. 1. On 7/25, the viewing day, I asked her to redo my grandmother's makeup because it was 10 shades too dark. She obliged. She had done a brown brow on my grandmother which I thought was strange since there's no brown in her hair so I asked her to switch it to black. She went and got the black and did it on both brows but when I told her that it looked too stark she got frustrated with me and said ""Well, you wanted BLACK so this is black. If you want the brown I will have to go get something to remove it."" She clearly did not want to move again and get the brown pencil to redo the brows. 2. I gave her the memorial video and told her to play it once after my speech, which she did. Then my mom wanted it to keep going so I went back to ask her to loop it. She was NOT happy. She said ""You didn't want to loop it so I put it away."" It was too much trouble for her to put the USB stick back into the computer and open up the file. It took a minute. She was sitting there on her phone when I approached her anyways so clearly she has time.3. During my mom's speech, her and her assistant starting removing the flower rings from the ceremony hall. I went up to her after 2 had been removed and said the ceremony is not over yet, can you hold off on removing them? That's when she completely SNAPPED. Her face turned red and lost her cool. She said to me ""You come here with me for a minute"" and stormed her way into the room next to the entrance. She said that we need to get our communication together. This has happened 3 times already (someone is counting and being petty). Someone told her that the ceremony was over and that's why she started moving things. Well, I explained to her that the family didn't realize we had all this time so we wanted to speak some more. She was clearly frustrated that different people were telling her different things which is understandable but to blow up at me like that at my grandmother's funeral is unacceptable. I was very angry when I went back to my seat. Shortly after the speeches ended I went back up to her and told her that ""You have no right to talk to me in this manner. You are at the service of my family."" She did not apologize and again blamed my family's communication. She told me in the most sarcastic tone that she was sorry that my family couldn't communicate. Then I told her that we were done and that she could move the flowers. She replied back in another sarcastic tone ""Thanks for your PERMISSION."" No apologies whatsoever for her bad attitude and unprofessional manner. I called the funeral home and left a message for the manager and general  manager yesterday to file a complaint against this funeral director but 2 days later, no one has called me back. Clearly, this business does not care about good customer service. Holly is not someone who should be a funeral director. She is rude, not accommodating and unprofessional and an embarrassment to the profession. Unfortunately, I will have to utilize this location again in the future but I will never ever use Holly again as the funeral director for my family's services.",aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g
6794,"Bad food and bad service. I didn't even bother taking a picture of my food when it arrived because it looked so sad. We had a group of 15 people so it was a lot for the server to manage understandably. She probably had other tables too. When she was bringing out the food she was carrying plates and a coffee pot and spilled hot coffee down the bare leg of someone in the group. Then at the end as she was trying to squeeze by another server, that was clearly in front of her with drinks, she knocked over a tray with 2 Bloody Marys and got the drink all over the other server and onto the floor. I don't know what was wrong with her but she was not having a good day. I ordered the chicken fried steak with over easy eggs and a biscuit on the side. It was the smallest biscuit I have seen served at a restaurant. About 2 inches in diameter and not impressive. The eggs were also overcooked. The chicken fried steak itself was okay but the gravy could have used more flavor. They were also very stingy with the gravy. There was only enough gravy to cover the steak. The potatoes were the worse. According to the menu these were supposed to be ""grilled potatoes"". I got slices of potatoes that had no signs of browning or grill marks on them. They were not crispy and had just been cooked through. They were not worth eating and I left them on the plate. Hot sauce could not save them. The food here is not good. My friend's eggs benedict had poached eggs with a solid yolk. If you want a good brunch, go elsewhere.

6795,"Not coming back again. I walked in at the same time as another couple at 5pm into an empty restaurant. They did not have a reservation and neither did I. She sat them in a prime spot near the window and proceeded to seat me at the tablet closest to the bathroom. The table where you would be looking at the bathroom door open/close all night. I asked her if there were other tables available and she said no. They were reserved for the night. How did the couple in front of me get such a drastically better table than me even though we both did not have reservations? Onto the food. Small menu that's heavily focused on vegetables which is not a bad thing if prepared properly. $4 to add avocado to a salad? Huge markup. Have you seen what avocados are going for at the grocery store? My friend got 1/2 avocado for $4. So that means they charge $8 per avocado. I understand that getting things in a restaurant is more expensive but this is just ridiculous. I ordered the bison burger with a side salad. The burger was good. It was meaty since it included 8 oz of meat. The salad was okay. Good dressing but the salad itself did not have much color, crunch or texture. My friend ordered the grilled and raw vegetable plate + avocado + chicken. She told the server she doesn't eat beets and guess what came on the vegetable plate. So much for ""writing down"" the food avoidances. Add injury to insult, the vegetables were grilled to a black char. The skin on this pepper she was eating was completely black and looked carcinogenic. Her broccolini was bitter. The chicken was good though. Our server came by once to ask how the food was and then to give us the check. She never refilled our waters even though our glasses were empty for a long time and we were still chatting. At the table right next to us, she was much more attentive. She brought a bottle of water over, refilled it several times and checked on them a lot more. Guess what? This couple ordered, alcohol, appetizers and entrees so she knew she was going to get a better tip over there. The only person who asked if we needed more water was this other person as she was clearing the table next to us, she looked and saw our poor empty water glasses.

Tip #3: Ask for a bottle of water because they will selectively refill your water.",aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g
6798,"Yikes. Pros: 2 hours validated parking at Avalon Towers. Parking its on the other side of the building down an alleyway. The one cocktail sampled was good. Cons: The food. We ordered a chicken flatbread, the ahi tuna tacos and miso roasted vegetables. The flatbread was the best item out of the 3 but that is not saying much when the other two were not good. The next best were the ahi tuna tacos. Plating was ugly. It was kale salad strewn over a chunk of overcooked tuna on one flimsy tortilla. Most places that do tacos will do a double tortilla and have a much better filling/topping. These tacos were overpriced at $14.50 for 3 tacos. The roasted vegetables were the worst. This mish mash of random vegetables (carrots, chard leaves and stems, parsnip, onions, etc) were half roasted and bland. I roast vegetables on a regular basis and these were not properly cooked.  No caramelization had occurred and the vegetables were partly raw which created this unpleasant texture because they were all cooked to different degrees. I cannot tell you emphasize enough how bad this dish was. 75% was left uneaten and the server doesn't care enough to ask if something is wrong.

6829,"Shady as hell. Doormen. They hire 4-5 men to just stand around near the entrance to open doors and start guiding you to a salesperson the minute you set foot on the lot. I'm going to detail our whole shopping experience and I will give a title for each section if you wish to skip to particular parts. The whole experience can be summed up in 3 words at the beginning of this review. Test drive: We told Ian from sales that we were only interested in test driving today and did not want to discuss purchasing a vehicle. Before the end of the test drive he started putting the pressure on and kept asking what he would need to do to sell us a vehicle that day. So we said yes, we can talk about some numbers. Negotiations: Don't make the same mistake we did and agree too quickly. When Ian told us that at this price the dealership was losing money, we thought it was a good deal. In the end we only got 7.5% off MSRP which was not the best deal. Ian kept saying how he only made $50 on this deal etc etc. We regret not walking away. Deposit: Then we told him we were not ready to buy today and he said that this price was only good for today and that we could put a deposit down to lock in the price. He said he normally asks for 1/3 of the vehicle price. Thinking back, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? How many people can afford to put down 1/3 of the vehicle price? Then he said, for you, I can just do $2000 non-refundable deposit. He made it seem like he was doing us a HUGE favor. Classic sales tactic. Once you put down the deposit, there is no more negotiation room. A $500 deposit would have been much more reasonable. Ian was probably jumping up and down with excitement at scoring big here. Financing: Fast forward a couple days later. He told us that this process would take 3-4 hours so be prepared for long waits. After much paperwork, he asked for a social security number to run a credit check. He said that without this he cannot sell us a vehicle. THIS IS NOT TRUE. It depends on how you want to finance the vehicle. Ian did not know what he was talking about. We refused and he had to bring his manager who again tried to talk us into letting them run a credit report. Once they have your SS# what do you think they'll be doing with it? I can bet that the credit inquiries will not be limited to the purchase of this vehicle. Financing Guy--Mike: This is where the dealership makes most of their money. Watch out for him. There was so much upselling going on here. He makes it sound like you need all these useless things. Additional protective coatings, maintenance packages, obsolete GPS trackers...I couldn't trust a word he said. Back to Ian. Ian is at least consistent in his story about only making $50 on this sale. I will give him that. He's probably one of the more experienced salesman on the lot. Once financing was taken care of and the car insurance checked out, it was time to go over the car checklist to ensure that the new owner knows the essentials. Ian did a lackluster job here and was distracted when going over things. After driving off the lot...We noticed that the tire pressure was different in all 4 wheels. Naturally, this would be concerning. We brought it back to the service department and they were like oh that's normal and were not interested in making any attempt to balance the tires out. Does that seem lazy to you?Hello dead car battery. The car was not driven for a week and parked in a garage and the car battery had died. Thanks Subaru for a crappy car battery. I didn't even bother calling the service department. It would probably be cheaper to go to Costco if I need to replace it. Subarus are nice cars but I will NEVER be going back to this shady dealership with their questionable practices. I would love to hear what other people put down as deposits to compare our experience.",aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g

We ordered the shrimp pan fried buns, handmade noodles with spicy sauce, pork and chive dumplings boiled, and scallop and chive dumplings pan fried. The buns were okay but not crispy enough and the skin was tough. The pork dumplings were the best out of the 4 entrees because the filling was juicy but I could buy a bag of frozen dumplings from Uwajimaya for the same quality. The scallop dumplings were deflated and underfilled. The interior of each dumpling was half empty. It was $5 more and all you get is one small scallop in each. At least throw in more chives. The handmade noodles had a good chewy texture but they were oily and not flavorful. The noodles didn't taste like anything. Last but not least, service was terrible. We arrived at opening time and nothing was ready. The place had 3 servers but they were disorganized and essentially a hot mess. The plates they brought out were wet, not just damp. I had to ask for napkins twice when all the tables around me had them. The girl hit me with the paper place mat. Another girl shoved food on the table without bothering to rearrange the plates. Tipping them 10 percent was more than they deserved. We will not be back. For the money we spent here I could have been dining at Din Tai Fung.",aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g
6867,"Haha, this place has an average 4 star rating on Yelp. No wonder people say they can't trust Yelp. My experience with Gentle Dental has ruined chain dental offices for me forever. Let me tell you about the issues I have with them. First visit for a cleaning, the dental hygienist left the polishing to the assistant. The assistant did not show up and I was left waiting in the chair for 10 minutes until I walked out. Then the dentist made some excuse about how the assistant was not feeling well. Second visit was for a filling. It felt like a rush job. I have no faith that this filling will last. The dentist is not experienced enough. Third visit for a cleaning. This was the last straw. A temp dental hygienist did my cleaning. She was the worst. She made my gums bleed and she blamed it on the health of my gums. How come Woodside Dental didn't make my gums bleed? Then the dentist comes in for his shotgun 2 minute exam. I had some questions for him about mouth guards and this new cavity he found on X-ray but he didn't take the time to answer them or debate the pros and cons with me. He just told me that I needed a filling and to have his assistant do a mold for the mouth guard. Seriously? Talk about not listening to your patient's needs. This is not a dentist who loves the profession and cares about the health of my teeth. I will never go to another Gentle Dental again. I happily went to Woodside Dental and I've never looked back.",aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g
6869,"The food truck visits my work parking lot once a week. I had a craving for fries and got an order of their Cajun fries to much on. She bagged the fries for me right after she took my money, which made me suspect those fries had probably been sitting there for a while. This was later confirmed when I tried them at my desk. Lukewarm, soggy fries. How can you sell these?Please fry them fresh when people order. Giving paying customers cold stale fries is not the way to do business. I will not be purchasing anything from this truck again.",aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g
6872,We chose Big Bus Tours as one of our 3 options for the Go Vegas Card and it was the most frustrating experience of the trip. We looked at the itinerary online and arrived 10 minutes before the bus was supposed to arrive at Ballys. We were waiting outside when the bus pulled up and we lined up behind this couple to try and board. A man who worked for Big Bus Tours let the couple in front of us on but did not let us on because he said that scanning our passes would DELAY the bus and made us wait for the next bus which was 15 minutes away. Apparently he had time to scan and input the passes of the couple in front of us but we somehow did not make the imaginary cut. I was beyond mad at this point at the ridiculousness of the situation. I told the employee that this was unacceptable and he did not apologize and merely told me to feel free to call and complain. He did not care. I called and spoke to his manager who told me that was the Big Bus Tours policy. If your pass is not already scanned and ticket in hand by the time the bus is here they will NOT hold the bus to scan your ticket. Maybe this information should have been in the FINE PRINT somewhere? I read through all of the information thoroughly on their website and did not see this fact mentioned. If I had to pay full price for this experience I would have asked for my money back and filed a discrimination complaint. Please don't waste one of your choices on the Go Card on this company. You are better off taking an Uber to downtown Las Vegas.,aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g
6873,Sad. Momiji's HH has been on a downhill trajectory since I started coming here years ago. We ordered the yellowtail sashimi set and 3 rolls from the HH menu. The slices of sashimi were thinner than before. The amount of cream cheese in each roll was thicker than the fish. I had a hard time seeing the salmon and eel in their respective rolls because the amount of fish was smaller than a finger's width. I estimate the rolls had ~25% fish. Please see my latest photo for comparison. The two rolls I ordered were both $13 regular price and $7 on HH and look at how differently they're sized. Can you spot the fish?,aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g
6875,My friend suggested that we try the HH at this place since it was newly opened but it was not worth the drive to Kirkland. This restaurant is confused with its service and food. I ordered gyoza from the HH menu and the tonkatsu ramen from the regular menu. The gyoza was a bit oily and did not come with a dipping sauce. The ramen was the worst. The broth was bland and salty. The pork was too fatty. The egg was just hard boiled. Absolutely nothing special about the ramen. To top it all off part my noodles were not cooked properly. See the clump of noodles in my photo. My friends ordered sushi but the waitress failed to give them soy sauce plates and even though they had ordered separately the kitchen put it on one plate. The sushi itself also was mediocre in flavor. Definitely not made by someone who is experienced in making sushi. Basically the entire experience was a failure. I don't understand why this place has any good reviews.,aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g
6881,"Price gouging auto repair shop. Estimate quoted by Dennis King. My windshields suddenly stopped working on my way to work on a typical rainy Seattle day. This shop was located near my work and at a glance was rated 4 Stars on Yelp. I called and spoke with Dennis and he said to drop the car off for them to take a look at it. I said great and dropped my car off for them to take a look. So I dropped my car off at 11am, Dennis called me with a quote of almost $800 at 4pm to replace the windshield wiper transmission. I had sticker shock. These were WINDSHIELD WIPERS. I was expecting $200-300 range for repairs. He told me the part itself was $500 plus 2 hours of labor (1 hour to take apart and 1 hour to put back together)...I had my suspicions about a quote this high and they were confirmed later that evening. I checked with Arrows Automotive, Superior Auto Service and Matt's in Greenwood and every single one gave me a quote drastically less than Greg's. 1. Arrows Automotive $400 + tax. Genuine Toyota part. 2. Superior Auto Service $317.55 (including tax). Off-market part.3. Matt's Greenwood Auto Care $303.24 + tax. Genuine Toyota part. Arrows and Matt's both called their vendors and told me the exact same price of $233.94. Both of these shops were getting them from the dealer. This is HALF of what Greg's was charging. Each shop also quoted me 1 hour of labor and Greg's quoted me 2 hours. I watched a Youtube video on how to change the transmission out, the mechanic was done in 20 minutes so 1 hour of labor is fair. Charging for 2 hours is price gouging. So when I went back to Greg's to ask for my car, they told me they had taken apart the windshield wiper transmission and that they would need to put it back together. I owed them $142.99 (1 hour of labor) for them taking it apart and putting it back together. If you bring your car here, ask about any costs you may incur if you choose to get it serviced elsewhere. I honestly felt like I wasted my money and time at Greg's. Please look elsewhere if you feel that the quote you received seems high. It is high. Do your research. I did mine and it saved me hundreds of dollars on a simple service.",aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g
6887,"The food and service were not worthy of a $$$$ price tag. The glowing reviews of this place led me to book it for my boyfriend's birthday but it was seriously the most overpriced food and worst service I experienced in Vegas. I regret the decision to come here so much. 1. Tuna Miso Chips. This was a slice of raw tuna served on what equated to a not so crispy waffle cut potato chip garnished with some greens and a sauce that did not go well with the tuna. 2. Miso Black Cod. This was the LEAST worth it dish of all. Everyone raves about this dish and I was expecting a nice sized piece of black cod but what I got were 4 TINY appetizer bites. The cod was good but why serve this on a random bed of butter lettuce garnished with the same white noodles in the center as the tuna miso chips. Serious lack of creativity. 3. Hamachi Kama. This was the best dish of all four but that is not saying much. The fish was at least tender. 4. Joyce Farms Chicken. The chicken was tender on this but I did not like the sauce. 5. Dessert. After the fails above, did you think I was going to be stupid and order dessert?Don't come here expecting good food or good service. The server would ask us how the food was and before we could answer he had already turned his back on us to talk to the table right next to us. This place is a joke. The Chef Nobu name does not mean anything here. I cannot believe so many people think this place is amazing.Have you ever gone somewhere and wished you didn't? Nobu was one of those places for me.",aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g
6895,"This was my second time at L&L and it was not good. I had been to the L&L in Federal Way but this one was more convenient so we decided to try it. Ordered a BBQ mixed plate and #21 Laulau and Kahlua pork combo. Both were disappointing in the quantity provided and the quality. I estimate that we got at least 25% less than the pictures on Yelp so they are not consistent. The #21 was seriously the worst entree. The pork was so dry. It's like they cooked the meat for hours too long. And the banana leaf wrapped meat was equally bad. You would expect the meat to be moist since it's wrapped in banana leaf but I could not even finish this. I don't understand the good reviews for this place. I will not be returning to this location to pay a premium for someone to overcook my meat. The Federal Way location is so much better.As a side note, we came on NYE and they were closing early so we could have just gotten the leftovers they were trying to get rid of which would explain why the food was not fresh.",aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g
6910,Given the good reviews of the sister restaurant we wanted to give this a try!  We ordered a chicken rice entree and a pork noodle entree. The meats were the most disappointing part. The chicken was thinly sliced and dry. The pork did not taste like grilled pork with that smokey flavor. The vegetables that came with the noodles looked and tasted fresh but I did not like the inclusion of mint. I don't think this is a typical and have never encountered mint before in my noodle bowls anywhere else. The rice entree was dry overall and the included sauce did nothing to salvage it. Clean interior. Nice soda machine and compostable packaging. But I would not go back for lack of authenticity.,aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g
6911,"I saw this restaurant listed on Eater Seattle under the best thai restaurants in the area and I was sorely disappointed. I knew this was a dingy hole in the wall place so I was not expecting good service and that expectation was met. I thought the food would be cheap and good but it also failed in that department. For 3 entrees, total was $38 and I rather have spent that on another Thai place. The pad thai barely had any meat, spiciness was lacking and my boyfriend described the flavor as oyster sauce. The fried tilapia was the best entree out of the three but I still wouldn't go back for it. The worst entree was the pad prik king (chicken and green beans). The restaurant does not use fresh ingredients, the green beans looked like they came from a can, mushy and flavorless. This was not worth the drive. I'm going to Chinatown next time!",aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g
6916,"I was surprised by how terrible this place was. We came for dinner on Sunday night while the Seafood Fest is in session. There was a skeleton crew probably because of the festival. We went to the restaurant thinking the food would be better than the stand at the festival but we were so wrong. We ordered the cajun salmon burger and the bacon cheese burger. The salmon burger was disappointing. The piece of salmon was tiny and thin. It only covered about 60% of the patty. The photos online of the burger looked better than ours. The piece of salmon that came in the salad looked bigger than ours. The bacon cheeseburger was a soggy mess. The cook did not toast the bun and proceeded to drown both sides of the bun in mayo. If you really like to see mayo coming out the sides of the burger, this is the place for you. I found it so disgusting that I could not finish my burger. The beef and bacon were both dry. I bit into something hard in the patty but couldn't tell what it was. I expected better for this price. I'm no newbie when it comes to burgers and this place is at the very bottom of my list.",aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g
6918,"I was craving Korean BBQ and wanted to try a new place after the rude service at Shin Sung close by. The service at this place is not much better and the wait staff don't really speak English. At 2pm, the food selection was half empty. Restaurant was pretty empty too. The ladies are slow to replenish the food and I had to ask if they had more beef slices. The meats were okay. Quality not great. A lot of fat on the frozen thinly rolled slices of beef. The beef short ribs were not marinated. The side dishes were mediocre. The kimchi was really sour and I couldn't even eat it and I normally love kimchi at most places.I will definitely not be back. This place did not satisfy my craving. $18.99/person Mon, Tues, Wed, Thurs$20.99/person on Fri, Sat, Sun$10 surcharge per person for excessive leftover food",aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g
6919,"Service is bad. We were the only group waiting on Sunday at 6:45pm and it still took her 5-10 minutes to get us a table. She also kicked us out right after we finished eating because there were other people waiting for a table. The server gave us the check before the last person finished eating, offered to pack up her food and then asked us how we were going to pay. We chatted for another ten minutes and then she told us to go to the counter to pay because there were lots of people waiting. I've never been kicked out of a restaurant like that before and I did not feel like we had overstayed our welcome. We were in and out in under an 1 hr for a group of 6. If the food was good then I would have rated this place 3 stars but I ordered one of the combination plates and the meat was so dry. It did not taste freshly cooked. The beef looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp until it was dished to us. My friend who got duck said her duck was not flavorful. The only person who liked their entree was my friend who got the alligator but she said that was dry too.I don't think I can understand the popularity of this place. I will not be coming back but I will come back for the BBQ shop next door. My friend's dad works there and he makes all their BBQ so I know its good.",aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g
6939,"This place was like overpriced Asian fusion cuisine. Reminded me of Cheesecake Factory but with way smaller portions. Ambiance is loud and rushed. Food is mediocre and overpriced. I honestly don't have a single good thing to say about the menu. We ordered a sushi roll, the fish sampler, a drink, the meatloaf and dessert and didn't like any of it. The onion rings on the meatloaf were soggy. Red Robin or anywhere else for that matter can do a better job. The dessert was death by chocolate, chocolate lava cake with chocolate ganache and then some hard sugar crust too. The drink was weak and didn't have any pineapple flavor as advertised. As for the sushi roll I would rather have eaten something from Sushiland. I'm from Seattle and I've been to some of the best sushi restaurants here and Roy's was just not good.",aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g

6958,"I asked for layers but Heidi used about five minutes (possibly less...) and used a razor on my whole head. I rarely have split ends (I have fine-medium, shiny, straight, healthy Asian hair that should not be difficult to cut at all) but after getting it cut by Heidi, I've never had more split ends in my life. My hair is rough to the touch, uneven in length, and there are thick chunks in certain areas. Overall, I came here because of the good ratings on yelp but I have no idea why anyone would come back to this salon. She took maybe 5 minutes razoring the life out of my hair (and with such speed that I doubt there was any structure to my cut) and then styled it with curls that made me look 35 instead of 21. The styling at the end also made it difficult for me to actually see what she had done to my hair. Oh, by the way, don't expect too much in terms of communication, I found it difficult to understand her English.Bottom line, maybe she can do a better job if you tell her specifically to not touch your hair with a razor, but I doubt that's how she gets through the number of customers that she does in lightning speed. Anyway, I am never going back to Heidi's Hair Design.",aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g
6959,"For 11.99 for dinner you think you would get more than a half filled bowl of rice and a serving of mostly cabbage with a few slices of meat. We ordered the lamb and house special pots. My lamb pot had 6 thin slices of meat, one triangle of tofu, one two inch piece of imitation crab, one egg, one small bunch of enoki mushrooms and the rest was cabbage and green onions in the broth. The house special was very similar except it had one quail egg, fermented tofu, and a different kind of meat. The WORST part here is the service and their lack of concern. My boyfriend has a peanut allergy and when we asked the server if there were peanuts in the hot pot or dipping sauces, he looked confused and said no. GUESS WHAT? The hot pot had peanut oil, leading to an unpleasant allergic reaction. If they had had actual peanuts and neglected to tell us, an ambulance would have been outside of the restaurant. I would never go back again to a restaurant where they don't care when you tell them you have a peanut allergy and they offhandedly tell you there is none in their food.",aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g

My total was $12.50, somewhere along the way the guy at the front desk added an extra dollar. I thought it seemed like more than it should have been when I paid but I didn't realize it for sure until I checked the menu after I got back home. I will NEVER be back again. The food was mediocre and not worth mentioning. An entree with peanut sauce had absolutely no peanut taste beyond the sprinkle of peanuts on top.

The vegetables were still hard and that's not how tempura should be. This place is trying to be all about Japanese fusion cuisine and tries to be creative and charges a lot for it. After eating $50 for two people we still left hungry. One word: Overpriced. I won't be back.,aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g
6969,"This place is pretty expensive for what it is. The food was okay. We got the Cove and was less than impressed. There was so little sausage and it was so bland from having been boiled. The chunks of potatoes were huge and bland. The whole thing was bland and dipping it in melted butter doesn't make the meal any better. The bread they served was mediocre as well. I won't be back. It would have been cheaper to boil shrimp, mussles and clams at home.",aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g
6980,"I was not impressed with this place. I came here with a restaurant.com gift certificate and was glad I did because the food was not worth the price I paid. The dinner buffet for $10 is more worth your money than getting the individual entrees. Service was bad even though most of the tables were buffet people. I had asked for ONE mango lassi and the server brought us two (we were charged for two). I tried to tell him that we had only ordered one but he never came back to check on us. Then he brought me ANOTHER drink that I did not order and I had to try really hard to get his attention that this was a mistake. And on top of that, several of the things on the menu were not available. We went early in the evening, around 6pm so I was not impressed that things were gone already.

They don't have tall plyo boxes, they don't have a stair master (at all!), their bathroom is gross. I have yet to shower but I'm seriously thinking about draping the floor with paper towels to avoid getting a fungal infection.  They don't sell pre-workout, their sad water fountain won't fill up your water bottle beyond half full.I'm just really surprised by the quality of this gym.

7021,"We had used DogCity for almost 3 years since getting our pup.  We don't have any complaints about their services or how they treated our dog.  As West Seattle has grown, so too has their size.  I was told my dog had recently displayed behavior issues- snapping, excessive barking- which they attributed to the increased number of dogs that they now oversee- anywhere up to 30 dogs from the 15-10 they had cared for before. To be fair, we had gone on vacation recently and was told Oliver was barking a lot- but they had commented it was likely due to us being away. I did follow-up on his behavior after returning from vacation and was told there were no longer any issues.  I'm 11 daycare stays into their 20 stay package (and again have been using their services for years). They initially told me packages are non refundable (which is ridiculous since that would mean they are essentially kicking my dog out and pocketing almost $200 of daycare I paid for), but after speaking to the owner they would refund me my remaining balance but deduct $50 for processing costs (which is better than a $200 loss, but still ridiculous).My 2 star review is reflective of how they handled this situation. I'm fine if they see my dog being a safety risk, but refund me the rest of the daycare package without these excessive processing fees- especially if I have been a loyal customer for almost 3 years and this issue was dropped on us without warning.Again, my dog loved coming here.  It sounds like the environment has changed with more dogs being cared for.  That may be something you want to consider for your pup. It also makes you think twice before investing in a multi-day daycare package if they can decide without warning to kick your dog out with days remaining in your package.",el0Kn3aNVz0c0lz_hKRmQg

Not sure what the purpose was of doing this. As a single, I'm forced to sleep on a twin as any attempt at rolling over to the next bed would force me in between both beds (the two twins are not fixed to eachother).and my twin bed is very uncomfortable-air conditioning hasn't worked for 3 days. Granted it's mid April, but my thermostat permanently reads 25C when I have it set for 17C. I had a coworker transfer to another hotel bc they had a medical condition that was aggravated by heat. I keep the windows open and hope the Barcelona bugs leave me alone.-do you want a dresser to stow your clothes while you attend a conference for a week? Too bad, they don't have one here. They also only provide you with 2 hangers. Oh, and if you need an iron that has to be requested as well.. And you can only keep it for a day. -do you want a desk to work on? You'll have to convert your only side table to a desk. And work from the bed.-don't expect to have much space to store your toiletries either. Some of them will have to sit inside the sink.-your shower doesn't have a door... -are you a fitness junkie?? Be prepared to enter exercise withdrawal. The gym is in the basement, and there is a sad treadmill, a few bikes, an elliptical and five weight machines that target random body parts.

You get the picture.When you actually try the food, you'll realize that the variety they offer is indirectly proportional to the quality of what you are eating.If you love seafood but are deathly afraid of consuming anything that could send you to the toilet for hours after, I recommend you avoid these:-the oysters: I've seen a film form on these before-salmon: today they were slimy.. Yuck -lobster: now while these are cooked, they are covered in this slippery sauce which makes it hard to hold/manipulate.  Also, when you finally make it to the meat, you will find yourself extremely disappointed at the amount of meat you find-mussels: yes they are delicious, but they are packed with this mayo/cheese sauce that will make an old sneaker taste good.My go tos:-The fried crab: delicious and cooked thoroughly -the soup station: add some quail eggs to the mix-the dessert: specifically, creme brûlée -roast duck: they do this right (for the most part)-the crepesAll of the servers are really nice.

7090,"This is a tough one to rate. We just ate here today and thought the food was not bad. It definitely does not compare to San Francisco, or Vancouver dim sum, but it wasn't terrible either. We had the siu Mai, shrimp dumplings, chive shrimp dumplings, the new year cake?, egg tarts and a 1/4 roast duck.  I was pleasantly surprised with the duck- the skin was crispy and the meat was flavorful.  The service was also very good for a Chinese restaurant.  Now here's where it gets difficult. It's been 6 hours since we ate here. I am obliviously ok, typing away this review.  My boyfriend has been going in and out of the bathroom, with Chinese food coming out of both ends (seriously) for the past 1.5 hours. We did eat the same food and it is likely he may have had a bad dumpling.  In any case, seeing how dim sum and a bowl of cereal consumed 13 hours ago were the only meals we had, I would lay the blame to the dim sum. This is unfortunate considering we were planning to return here in the future. Overall, the dim sum is decent if you're willing to risk food poisoning (and the associated cleanup).",el0Kn3aNVz0c0lz_hKRmQg
7107,"I was expecting more from this place because I had such a good experience 3 years ago. Service was just mediocre.  We had a long wait between appetizers and the server taking our order, but maybe she didn't want to disturb us.  I ordered the bone in ribeye medium rare, it came out medium and medium well in some areas. The server claimed that the bone in ribeyes typically come out like that... Really? I don't think so. The bf got a medium well filet- guess what his steak looked like? Pink in the middle. Which leads me to think the server mixed up our orders- which is fine, just admit to it instead of trying to convince me I don't know how to order steak.  For the price you pay here you expect quality steak and quality service. Will I be back? Probably not- this place will be closing a year from now and I'm sure I can find plenty of other good steakhouses to spend  my money on.",el0Kn3aNVz0c0lz_hKRmQg
7110,"I'm always a fan of Best Western and seeing how this hotel had such positive reviews I was optimistic.  We checked in fairly easily and the attendant at the counter was pleasant.  My 1 star is based on the condition of the room.  There is a strong musty odor to the room upon entering- and I would be ok with this since he hotel was a great deal and it seems older.  Now what I'm not ok with is finding strands of hair on the floor and PUBIC hair in the bathtub. That is definitely gross and unacceptable and I would give this place 0 stars just for that. I called to the front desk attendant who informed me there were no other rooms available and that he had no staff to clean the bathroom.  Wonderful. I'll be showering in my flip flops BW because I don't trust the quality of cleanliness of your establishment.  I'm not blaming the attendant at all, but there should be a standard in terms of cleaning.  I mean, would you want to shower in a tub with a stranger's pubes sprawled out?I honestly am considering staying at a different hotel if we had any other options within Bath and if I was guaranteed a refund from BW for the 3 nights I have booked.Overall- if you can avoid this place, then do it.  I will be weighing my options tomorrow when I speak to the general manager.",el0Kn3aNVz0c0lz_hKRmQg
7111,"This may be the first time I've slept on a hotel bed that caves in from weight. I am literally rolling onto my boyfriend as I type at 3am in this hotel room- and we are far from being large people. The quality of this room is just terrible- the bed condition (springs pushing up against my back) to the toilet not flushing completely, to the small room size (you have to close the door of the bathroom to get to the toilet, and there's no way you can fit 2 people in there) does not seem up to par with other Hilton hotels I've stayed at.If all of the rooms in this hotel are in a similar condition, I would avoid this hotel if you can.",el0Kn3aNVz0c0lz_hKRmQg
7114,"Woah- all of the employees here have a major attitude problem. I get it, you work at lululemon, the store that sells overpriced spandex and has a thing against larger women. I have the impression many of the people who work here wish they lived in a major city, because their pretentious attitude certainly does not belong in Milwaukee.So why such a negative review? Well 1) there are employees (who are wandering around the store and not busy at all) who fail to ask if you need help while you stare at their plethora of crops and pants and 2) upon exiting the fitting room, you have an employee who is too busy texting on their phone to acknowledge your thank you, or see if you could use another size. It's called customer service ladies, and it's customer service that gets customers to invest in your ridiculously priced products. No thank you Lululemon Milwaukee, I'd rather spend my money in Chicago- where the employees are expected to be pretentious but aren't",el0Kn3aNVz0c0lz_hKRmQg
7116,"Came here when the line for brunch at Au Cheval was out of control. I heard good things about this place from a friend so I wanted to try it out.They have your traditional taqueria fare at relatively inflated prices- think $3.50 per taco. I had the pastor and duck confit while the bf had sautéed shrimp and chorizo.  I can't say the tacos were amazing, and when you consider the price i would say they are ok.  We also had the chips and guacamole, though again, there's nothing extraordinary about them.  The service and drinks  are average as well. So overall, we had a Ho-hum experience and probably won't be back because, quite honestly there are better Mexican restaurants around at a fraction of the price.",el0Kn3aNVz0c0lz_hKRmQg

It's all you can eat sushi for $14- what do you expect. What I did not appreciate was tip already added to the bill- Who does that?! Is that even allowed? Shouldn't there be some sign on the menu about this automatic service charge? Come here if you're desperate- but I still stand by my previous recommendation of going down the street to Tatsu if you are willing to spend extra cash.",el0Kn3aNVz0c0lz_hKRmQg
7182,"It's not hard becoming aware of any new restaurant in Little Italy/Taylor Street.  The last few have been clear winners: 3 aces bar, Davanti Enoteca.  Both target different clientele, but both deliver.  So when this place opened, I had high expectations.  We were sat at the communal table and found out we had to move so for the inconvenience we had we received a free glass of champagne- that was nice.  The decor was also fancy, considering the other restaurants sprinkled along Taylor Street.  The food:-The lentils were delicious- probably not the best but definitely better than the rest -Apple salad- delicious! The apples were soft, the goat cheese was amazing.-Little neck clams- so so, probably a 3 out of 5.  Not the best. I would probably skip this altogether.-We also ordered maybe a carafe of wine- which waasn't badOverall, our experience was so-so.  I probably wouldn't come here again since I could go to Davantis for tapas or 3 aces to enjoy a good beer.  There are also a ton of places downtown and in the West Loop that could easily satisfy my tapas craving at the same price.",el0Kn3aNVz0c0lz_hKRmQg
7185,"The sushi was okay.  My parents got the deluxe dinner for 3.  It included a gigantic dish full of your choice of sashimi, mackerel, chicken teriyaki, sukiyaki, soup, and salad.  All this for for $46! Not bad huh? The food was decent- not the best, but it's a good deal.  We also got 4 rolls for two people:  the lion king roll was good but its hard to go wrong with mayonnaise.  We also got the crunchy roll, the WA roll and the cherry blossom roll.  Again, the sushi is ok- nothing to rave about. What really docked the review was the service.  Our one server looked inconvenienced by us. She couldn't communicate that our table needed to be cleared so she attempted to place the dish on our food already on the table! WTH! Then when we were ready for the bill, she forced the styrofoam box in front of my face rather than placing it on the table or offering to place the food in the box instead.  Terrible customer service. Fortunately, it was just this one server who was terrible.  The others seemed much nicer and more accommodating.",el0Kn3aNVz0c0lz_hKRmQg
7188,"For a 6 course meal that was so so- it came out to a $91 check with a 10% off coupon ..  Oh and they automatically add 20% gratuity to the bill (with 2 people) FYI.But enough complaining, about the food:-Started off with their sangria.  Personally don't think it was very strong- in fact it was too sweet-the bacon wrapped dates are a 7/10 compared to avec.  I mean they are good, but it's hard to go wrong with bacon wrapped dates.-Their lamb meatballs, a 6/10.  Nothing too amazing here  -We also had the pumpkin gnocchi- which was delicious.  I would say skip this place overall as you can find just as good or better for much less (i.e. Avec, or even purple pig)--Thank you Antonio for your response to my review.  Just to clarify, our $91meal did not include the $56 prix fixe menu, so we did order the items we wanted- maybe 5 total.  We ordered one order (carafe?) of sangria. And then there was that 20% gratuity that was automatically added to our bill (I have no idea where this came from- maybe it was a consequence of using a 10% off coupon that I received when I checked in on Yelp?)",el0Kn3aNVz0c0lz_hKRmQg
7189,Went here last night for dinner bc Purple Pig was packed.  We started off with the house margarita and the topshelf guacamole.  I had the tamales barbacoa. Friends had enchilada barbacoa and something else.  The food was okay. Nothing amazing- although you would expect it from the price. I wasn't blown away despite the $70 tab for 2 people.  I would skip this place overall- you can get a better dinner for under $20 at any taqueria.,el0Kn3aNVz0c0lz_hKRmQg
7192,"My initial review still stands, this is merely a follow-up.  I would have given one extra star, but chose not to- and here's why:I receive my glasses, which exceeded my expectations in terms of look.  The only problem was my vision while wearing them.  I had them fitted when they came in, but at the time I was wearing my contacts so I didn't know if the blurriness was due to me wearing both.  So I'm not quite sure what the issue is since the Rx, as I was told, was the same Rx as my contacts, which are perfect.  Anyhow, I will have to go back in (which is a first for me).I ordered contacts last week (after a week trial of new my contacts, which is recommended).  As of today, they hadn't come in, so I came in asking to purchase another set of contacts so I would not exceed the 2 week duration for my 2 week disposable contacts.  The gentleman at the counter was kind enough to give me another pair of contacts (which would have warranted an extra star).  Since my work schedule is hectic right now (it's not easy getting to work after 9am, or off before to make a 5pm appt, and I work Saturdays)- I asked if I could have the contacts mailed to me.  From what I remember, the last gentleman who helped me informed me they were competitive with 1-800 contacts.  I found out to ship my contacts would cost $7.00.  I asked about their willing to compete with 1-800 contacts in terms of shipping, and I was told the internet company only offered free shipping with a certain # of orders- which is not true.  In any case, I canceled my order with level optical for this reason alone:1)They did not seem to care about customer service (okay fine, I left a pretty negative review so maybe they hate me now.  I think the best way to approach people like me is to prove me wrong- improve your customer service, and in return, I would definitely change my rating).  It is hard to keep returning during their hours to get my contacts/glasses fixed.  I think the least any company can do is help make this easier.  Them offering to mail my contacts without a charge (as they claim they can do if they do indeed compete with 1-800 contacts), would have remedied the situation.  I have to return one more time to see what's going on with my glasses- which I am not looking forward to.  I would take my business elsewhere if I didn't spend so much money on my glasses in the first place.",el0Kn3aNVz0c0lz_hKRmQg
7197,I would add 0 stars as well if I could.I actually did not use homescout but I responded to an ad where Clayton Hines was advertising an apt. I saw the place and then realized it was just too small of a space to live in. I told him this and he offered to help me find other apartments. I told him what we were looking for and that was that. Now I've had the same conversations with other realtors before and most just drop out of communication- so I was okay when Clayton did the same. We ended up finding a much nicer unit with more space for a little more than what we wanted initially- but it was worth it. Clayton follows up about a week after we sign the lease and he starts harassing me via email and phone about how disappointed he was that I didn't ask him to represent us for a unit WE found on craigslist. Really? We went and did the work and responded and set up an appointment pretty easily with the apartment complex. Why would we have a third party involved? Ridiculous! So he goes and inquires with the apt complex about how we went about finding the listing to make sure we didn't go through another realtor.  So overall- I found an apartment on my own. I got 2 angry emails and a phone call where Clayton basically made me feel guilty about,el0Kn3aNVz0c0lz_hKRmQg
7198,"I came in hopeful for triple 1- it's near my apartment and it seemed to have decent reviews. Unfortunately my expectations weren't met- here's why:1.authenticity: Now I'm not saying this Restaraunt isn't authentic, but it definitely lacks a lot of the essentials I would see at other authentic restaurants. I asked if they could make Salted Fish fried rice, which is on my list of essentials. Most Chinese restaurants make this and if it's not on the menu, they can whip it out. When I asked, apparently the server had no clue so I ended up instead with fried fish over rice. This was okay- probably 3 stars, average and nothing spectacular.What really disappointed me was the roast duck.  I grew up in the bay area of CA- so I would make it to the SF Chinatown at least once a week growing up.  I know what good roast duck taste like: crispy delicious skin that melts in your mouth and oily tender meat- yum! You can find this quality at even the cheapest restaurants in the SF Chinatown. The roast duck at triple 1 came out oversauced, chewy, and not fresh tasting at all.  Definitely a 1 star rating.  I would skip this dish altogether.I probably won't come back here. I've found some decent places in Chinatown here. I guess the trek on the red line is worth it.",el0Kn3aNVz0c0lz_hKRmQg

I'm actually writing this review as I'm in the store... on one of their MacBook Pros.. yes, that's how long I've been waiting and how upset I am.  I'm writing a not so good review of them in their store.  I guess I may change this review.. once I get seen.. if I ever get seen.",el0Kn3aNVz0c0lz_hKRmQg
7203,"This review is based on my last experience here, which was today, July 4.  I've been here twice before and would probably rate those times as 3 stars for the service, food, etc.  Today was just not a good day apparently.  We decided to sit at the bar and despite the fact that virtually no one else was at the bar, the bartender seemed extremely inconvenienced by our choice of seat.  Now I understand that it's asking a lot to have a bartender prepare both drinks and serve, but if that's too much trouble, remove the seats at the bar or find a bartender who can manage both.  Our drinks were taken without enthusiasm, and again, I understand- it's July 4, and it sucks to work when it's a beautiful day outside.  Unfortunately, 90% of people have to work holidays.. so suck it up.  Our experience worsened throughout and I'll save the details.  Mostly the attitude of the bartender irritated me the most.  When our bill came, she accidently charged me for a drink which was included in my meal.  When I brought this discrepency up, she became even more hostile.  She returned my bill and credit card and basically just identified which receipt she needed back.  No thank you. No have a good day/good 4th of July. Nothing.  So overall: Hawkeyes is usually okay.  I'll give it to them because it was one of the few places open on July 4th, they serve TATER TOTS, and their servers are generally pleasant to be around.  If you go, I would highly recommend against sitting at the bar and expecting to get served.. you may be in for a terrible experience depending on who's behind the bar.  Be wary about bartenders who complain about their life and who can't manage to multi-task their responsibilities.",el0Kn3aNVz0c0lz_hKRmQg

Overall, I suggest you go elsewhere.  Find a salon that values your business and that strives to create an image you desire. If you want a great colorist- make a trip to Seattle and see Jessica at Caruh Salon (also uses Aveda).  She really knows the products and is the best colorist I've had.",el0Kn3aNVz0c0lz_hKRmQg

I drifted in today for a pick me cup of java and left scratching my head on this place and then the kick back accrued. First off I thought the place looked very nice yet decor does not create an amazing cup of coffee. So I order two americano's. Mine comes out in seconds which is strange and at a temperature of  10,000 degrees Fahrenheit so enjoying it right away wasn't gonna happen. The next awkward moment is they insist on adding your sugar into your coffee. WTF are you kidding? Are you limiting sugar on an island who promotes sugar diabetes and tooth decay by making sugar. Let me tell you something , I like placing my own sugar and cream into my coffee it's part of my morning ritual. Once my java cooled down I take a sip and ughhhhh it's horrible. Favor tastes weak over burnt beans. I tried to enjoy it yet after a few more sips this horrible cup of java went directly into the garbage. I'd have been better off getting a cup at the ABC STORE verse subject my body to another sip. The only positive note of my experience was the cup slip case for photo opp's with Little Donnie.

I ordered a two meat platter of brisket & sausage which came with the fixings of coleslaw, potato salad & beans.  Potato salad was like Mom made back in the day to cheers to the chef on that but the rest was ok. Here's my issues with the meats. Cold and looked and tasted like it had been reheated for serving. Brisket didn't have the oozing of rendered down fat like most brisket fresh off an 18 hour smoke. I'm been all o sr Texas and every quality smoked brisket oozes with fat when it's served. This defiantly was sitting either overnight or chilled from day before... As for the sausage well it was like warm but has huge potential if he can serve it hot. Not much else to say cause anyone knowing the pleasure of smokes meat will get what I'm saying. Now I honestly think you have potential on your product, yet with the standards set by The Lone Star State you better believe I measure all BBQ by that standard. If you doubt what I'm saying then take a trip to Lockhart , TX and you have 3 of the States top BBQ joint in one tiny city or stop by Franklins in Austin and wait 5 hours in line.

Well, the pretzel shows up and we're cutting into it and savoring the look and smell of it, I take a bit with jubilation and was all smiles as I savored it. OK, now the yuk factor happens. I cut into the pretzel again and as I'm lifting it up to place into my mouth I see a giant white hair hanging off my pretzel and fork, EWWWWWWW! We notify the waitstaff and the offending pretzel & hair is taken away as we watch in disgust. A manager then comes over to apologize which is always appreciated and a new pretzel arrives. No harm no foul until my special lady friend cuts into her bratwurst and attached to it is another long disgusting hair. She now is starting to feel queasy and nauseous and head to the bathroom to give it all back. So now as you can imagine our meal is an official disaster and we notify manager again.

I felt like I was in the movie One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest and I was RP McMurphy seeking a lobotomy to blend into the crowd. After suffering severe smoke inhalation from patrons puffing away I found a slot machine I normally play (BUFFALO), however this casino's slot machines are so tight it reminded me of a date I had in high school ( Wink Wink ). Unfortunately there was no payoff with the machine ( date was another story ). My biggest complaint is the bonus rounds on ""The Buffalo"" slot machine never came up. $500 later not one bonus spin's. WTF That's insane, it's never happened ever when I played that machine. So I believe management has tuned down the winning on these slots to make it impossible for any hope of winning. Eventually I moved to the 21 table where this dealer punished the table with almost 20 hands straight. However the dealers luck changed and his winning streak ended, thank god. My clothes permeating with second hand smoke which needed to be burned after my casino visit, I ventured over to the concert venue for a most enjoyable evening with Mr Peter Frampton.

7272,"Not exactly a premier stadium you'd want to chill out at for spring training. I found the amenities for coming to a game here probably the worst in the Cactus League. A truly outdated relic of what stadiums were like 35 years ago. Yet the Valley of The Sun and home of the Cactus League for Major League Baseball  this stadium has scene better days and nights. It's time to tear down these walls Artie and build a first class stadium for the ANGELS like the other teams play ball in. It's time for an upgrade to a modern field with parking, not only for the team but THE FANS!So let's discuss parking first. Most of the parking is in an industrial park and you'll 3 to 5 block journey begins. Now having elderly parents I'm offended by the parking situation.  Once I made it into the stadium well let's just say the leg room factor is nada.. You'll either bang your knees sliding into your seat or step on everyone's feet. Your body is so cramped in the seat you wish you had slummed it and brought a towel and laid on the grass in the outfield. Food well it's ball park food so you either love it or hate it, I'll leave that for your taste buds.  However beer is plenty full to enjoy on a hot day so drink up...Well, if you read what I said and still desire to go , then it's on you!

So I order up the unlimited soup and salad special. Now I'm no gluten but I at least wanted an option for a refill of my soup and maybe a side of some dressing but NO!!!!!  I guess the waitress waited to put me on a diet for some reason cause I didn't get refill of either my salad, soup or Coke. Hell I could have reached over the counter and refilled the Coke myself but the law might not have appreciated that move. So I left hungry and disappointed with a empty soup spoon in my hand.  From what little Pasta Fagioli soup I received the flavor was amazing as usual, yet my salad was a little under in dressing department , but had she checked on me I could have asked for more.

Dog in The Park was not the greatest dog I've ever eaten and the cleanliness of its condiment area was disgusting. OK, the dog wasn't one of those delicious Chicago style dogs nor even an a beef Costco dog. I'm almost sure after seeing it, that he's selling Ballpark Franks from the grocery store verse having an amazing gourmet style dogs. I'd pay the extra buck for something of quality. My other grip is these dogs were cold and needed a grilling which so I'm not sure if the correct temperature for serving was used.Ok, in order for you to understand the uncleanliness of the condiment area I included some photos. Everything  is exposed to the eliminates.  Jalapeños are an open can for anyone to reach into so people to spread there flu germs on or a bird to drop a gift into.

First and foremost the line to get it moves fast unless you want an outdoor table which I did. Now the good outdoor seats are located curbside next to the sidewalk and one was open. Since we were first in line you'd expect the seating host to put you there. Instead she placed us in cramped table for two and then put the lady with her kid that was behind us in the nice comfortable round table that was rightfully ours. So the was a major piss me off moment. I'm mean really why on earth do that, I'll tell you why cause minimum wage employee and lacks no brain cells. There's a reason why they make the minimum wage and it shows!Ok, so I order the meat skillet (potatoes , meat, cheese ) which is ok in taste. On second thought I should have ordered the western version, I think the peppers & onions with ham would have been what I would have enjoyed. It came with pancakes & egg so its a large meal.

Why cause the food was burnt and I received zero service so no one deserves a dollar more from Frank B. Ladies & gentleman of this jury these are the facts of what happened to me at Thai Tom:Now I showed up and ordered 2 items for my lunch. Frank orders consisted of Pad Thai with chicken & chicken cashew. The chef prepared my dishes a lady delivered them:Chicken Pad Thai was subpar and noodles burnt crispy. Burning the noodles is a violation in my book. Needless to say they weren't tasty. Next my chicken cashew showed up looking very vegan since there was absolutely zero presence of any chicken in the dish. The dish should be overflowing with chicken and not the small micro pieces I received.

All that ended on the night of May 4th 2017 when the day I entered and ordered THE PORTERHOUSE for 2...  Upon arrival we was seated by a lovely lady handling these duties and another gentleman took over from there to assume his duties as our waiter for the evening.

This meaty think cut  piece of swine was grilled to our delight ( highly recommend getting some ) and moments later our salad was delivered. So after an hour wait we're told there was an accident and our food would delayed? I didn't here an explosion in the kitchen so I was mystified as to what happened. We're informed later the plate exploded and that's what delay was. The main event The Porterhouse aka signature dish on the menu finally shows up and it's not meeting my expectations right away. First off it's half cooked and dark purple on one side ( We asked for lite pink inside  aka medium to medium well ) not butchers block purple! It appears the chef cook one side well and barley cook at the other. We looked at each in disgust and tasted it. $100 steak flavorless and cold and undercooked. I guess based on our looks the manager came by and asked us what was wrong. I explained the obvious and showed him the issue. He offers to throw back on the grill and I saw ""NO"", cause you know any steak worth eating should never be double cooked. All the juice goes out of it and then it's ruined. Graciously he offers another but it's 9:30 at night and I'm not waiting another hour and I had other plans so I decline. He says he will not charge me for the steak. But charges me for bacon & salad. I kinda look at him like WTF. I'm thinking this entire disaster should be comped due to the kitchens mistake. Now I'm mad so I throw down some cash and leave in disgust. It's a principal issue on why I should have any bill at all. What a disappointment this experience this was to me and guest.

7401,"20% Tip included into bill is a complete rip off. Frank was so thrilled to be finally dining in this establishment last Saturday night. I made the 15 mile drive through the hood just to get here. Street parking which had open spots really made my evening and was a high sense of relief. Since I was dining alone I was told the last seat at the bar was open. Ok, I thought but I was famished and needing some nourishment big time. I sit down ordered a wine from the bearded man. Then the bearded man places this card in front of me and says a 20% gratuity will be added to my bill ""do I mind"" he asks. Hell ya I mind, but what choice did I have. My engagement was at 8pm so I accepted and assumed I would get 20% worth of service, NOPE I GOT ZERO SERVICE worth 20%.... Fundamental problem with this new idea of a 20% gratuity just added before service is waiter & staff become lazy.   So I order my meal and it shows up. I ask for steak sauce and they don't have any, wahhh. I ask for salt & pepper and to this day it's never showed up. The bearded man was a chatty Kathy with the couple next to me all through my dinner I had to listen to the bloke slobber all over them and tell his life story. Blah Blah Blah! All I got was his lady friend hates his garlic consumption , like I care TMI.... it wasn't until I finished he basically uttered more words to me to blow up my bill with a desert menu.....So for 20% that is what I paid for a service, and it shows! My steak & frites combo was sensational. Almost one of the tenderest rib eye steaks I've ever eaten. The steak butter which accompanied it absolutely made the steak for me. The side of fries with garlic aioli sauce topped of my meal and told me this place knows how to make a proper steak for consumption.My issue is not with the 1st class cut of beef I was served , that's was amazing. It was the 20% which was tagged onto my bill and then failed to deliver on the service which was poor. This trend for restaurants needs to stop or people shall stop patronizing them.

I was very amused at the sign stipulating ""No Kite Flying"" In park. So for you kids wanting to fly your kites go stand across the street for your fun.Well, if you don't believe Frank go see for yourself.",MeDuKsZcnI3IU2g7OlV-hQ

7411,"Dumplings of Fury was a not anything as I had hoped for when it comes to dumplings. Instead of the fury I got a whimper in flavor! Photos of this place gave me hope in flavor morsels exploding in my mouth like Pai Mei's Five-Point-Palm Exploding-Heart punch yet it tasted like I went to vegan frozen food section at Safeway. Needless to say I was disappointed.I ordered the Beef Jiaozi (Braised Beef, Ginger) dumplings and it tasted very cardboard like. Not even additives enhanced its flavor which made it a complete failure in my mind.  Also as part of my order was BAO Fried Chicken bun which has some flavor but  not much better than the $1 chicken sandwich at McDonalds. Defiantly not worth $9 in my opinion. $20 wasted for lunch and I'm still hungry. All I really got was a lesson on why I should stick with quality places for lunch.",MeDuKsZcnI3IU2g7OlV-hQ
7422,One of my least favorite places to play soccer. Parking is a drag plus if you park on street there's a giant lip for you to scrap your tire rims on. Now because there's a pond or lake next to the field there's a great possibility of losing your $150 soccer ball when it flys into the lake. Come on the least you could do is put up nets to avoid ball loss or drowning.On a positive note there nice new field turf down on the ground. Fake grass is amazing to play on.

All she did was stand there hit Burger & fries and hand me a cup. Where does this warrant a tip. McDonalds doesn't do this practice to there customers.

Yet I wonder if this journalist writing review had ever eaten deep dish pizza from The Windy City itself or if he was writing this while sipping his chilled carrot & pomegranate shake.  So I stopped by tonight to discover for myself. Well, I stepped up to counter hungry and ready for pizza. I ordered THE BUGSY pie & consumed. Lets just say ""Wahhhhhhhhhh"" it's not worthy.Ok, it's a small storefront with a few tables inside and out. Menu located on giant wall chalkboard with pizza choices scribbled onto it. I pick the flesh pizza THE BUGSY which was sausage & pepperoni. My first question to pizza maker is WHERE WAS ALL THE FLIPPING MEAT? I got heavy on the crust & sauce and enough cheese to clog my Carotid Artery but hardly zero meat. Look man a meat pizza has to have meat on it, so a note to pizza dude and that's stop being cheap and load the pie up with meat meat and more meat. Hollywood Pie had some flavor yet did not deliver an orgazmic knockout power punch of flavor to my tastebuds. The wrap up is this is not one of the better pizzas I've eaten and it shows. I ate almost 3 slices and left the rest for the buzzards to feed off of. Good luck guys I wish you success but it's LA and places come and go and I'm sure the review won't help you yet it's my humble and honest opinion.Frank is out!",MeDuKsZcnI3IU2g7OlV-hQ

It was interesting seeing a full parking lot and then some derelict with piece of crap car scooping the others cars out in the lot so beware. Then while strolling around I'm looking at the cd's section and some dude who's looking as well, but he's barefoot, WTF. Bare feet are you kidding it's winter and the brown shoe section was upstairs. Aside from the brown shoes you'll find the most horrific ties known to man kind. Who bought these to begin with and why resell them.

Guy as he does hyped it up, so I needed a taste test myself. I roll up in my ride and notice a nice parking lot for parking next to the Meat Shack where Matt serves. Ordering I have the chopped brisket , potato salad & coleslaw. Plus a side of sausage. Let's start with the sides and my potato salad was delicious almost perfect specimen ( thanks ) but the coleslaw was lack luster with very little taste in my opinion. Here's where it went south. Well, I paid for the sausage yet it was not given to me so BITE ME MATT, I don't like being ripped off. Brisket order was a chopped brisket which I wasn't sure if they sauced it or was just wet, but not the best brisket I've ever eaten and I've had brisket all over Texas. If your selling it I expect it to be like a Texas pit master does it. I saw some whole slices on the counter that looked really tasty so my mistake may have been ordering chopped.    Not sure where I sit with Matt's based on my meal and getting ripped off on my side of sausage was a major disappointment in my book.

Wait there's more!!Taco had very little cheese or lettuce and shell was stale ( that's a huge yuk ) and my tamale was hard at ends and had zero flavor morsels to salivate over ( wahhh ). Lunch basically blew to my disappointment.I ate about half and considered dining & dashing but my moral compass suggested I pay for the epic failure of a lunch. And to top off everything 10 brats and a few stay at home moms bring this hurd of creatures into to raise the noise level up and ruin the peace and quiet of the establishment.  Would have been easier to make tacos and enjoy a real tasty meal vs this disgusting option.,MeDuKsZcnI3IU2g7OlV-hQ

I was drawn into it by the TRUMPHOBIA therapy and get well cards add on the outside window.I enter and shimmy through the shelfs looking at the stock and quickly came to conclusion that this was a new used store. Prices marked on the books appeared were all under $10 so bargain shopping was in order. I did find a book on George Bush & Dick Cheney with imagery of them as Devils. I wasn't sure if it was a cookbook for spicy Mexican food or Global warming. But what really caught my eye was the Donald Trump superman coloring book. I think that was the therapy they were offering, however I received no hugs or positive affirmations while I was in the store.  Now if your a Bob Dylan fan they claim to have over 35 books about the man himself. I'll take there word for it since I didn't wanna count all 35 books to verify. What seemed odd at the unique store was that it was also sharing its space with a comic shop that was equally as odd.

In fact worst  car dealership experience ever!Ok, so I make an appointment with sales flunky named David. I show up and he's actually there and waiting.

Well this is the part people where it gets funky so hang on.  Ok all the cars on lot are Filthy Dirty on the outside. Really you can't hire lot boys to wash these Germans up so a prospective buyer gets excited?  Now I'm not really seeing what I want but I locate a vehicle I almost like so I inquire about getting some changes that should be very basic. I wanted the upgraded BMW sound system, change the trim on dash and different rims & tires. Keep in mind I was willing to pay for all these items. So David now refers me to YouTube for do it yourself repairs on changing out dash. REALLY like I'm gonna go onto eBay as he suggested and buy parts and change out on my own. Dude this is BMW I don't do repairs, that's service departments job. On another car I didn't like the paint job so David says get your car wrapped and no one will ever know. OMG is this guy for real? Now every time I asked for something I was willing to pay for he kept saying his mantra  "" oh that's expensive"" and I kept repeating but I want it done. This guy even busted out Yelp reviews on after market car stereo dealers when I specifically wanted BMW system installed into the car. I about bust out laughing on the YELP app part.I mean this guy was clueless on the art of the deal. I should have went to book store and purchased him the DONALD TRUMP book to clue him into sales 101. This dealership was a joke and I'd highly advise you to stay away and go elsewhere for a true BMW car purchasing experience.  After 2 hours of pain staking negotiation David said he needed to get some sales tax information to make deal happen. He said I'll call you in a few hours. Frank needed a cocktail due to this morons poor sales ability. So I headed to my favorite bar Tiki Ti to consume several cocktails to forgot him. 6 hours later he finally called and says car is gone. Well David I'd already had given you THE FINGER long before you called.

Unlike Bourbon street with free access 24/7 , on Beale Street during the weekends you have to go thru a TSA style strip search just to enter which to 45 minutes just to enter the drinking zone. No order judging by the angry people waiting to enter. It's just hurry up and wait and hope you get in. Once your caged inside well it's multiple drinking establishments all peddling Booze and maybe some music... My favorite is ""The BIG ASS BEER"" and a true rookie classic the giant 3ft glass full of god knows what.

7719,"Harrys was a local eatery about one step above a Denny's for locals to gather around to drink and consume subpar food.Ok just so I don't seem like a grump, but here are the facts. So the waitress takes appetizer order and my special lady friends meal order and then turns to take off. ""Frank goes hey what about me"" Like really, I'm paying the flipping bill and your not even gonna ask what I want, get real. So my SLF asks for no onions 3 times and guess what here meal and onions are on it . So she takes it back and bang onions again. So twice with onions and returned. What a waste of two orders of steak tips cause you cant fulfill a simple order of no onions. She asks if I want a refill of Coke and she brings Diet Coke (wtf). Now I ordered the ribs and frankly they weren't that great. Ends were overdone so 3 ribs of the rack were wasted and non edible. However the wings did rock with flavor bursting juices.Those are the facts so you judge if you dare, but Frank won't be walking in that door anytime in the future.",MeDuKsZcnI3IU2g7OlV-hQ

The pool is over crowded buy the geriatric love boat crowd all guzzling down there al inclusive free watered down drinks. The restaurants & bars are a disaster. To order anything takes for ever and a committee of waiters to figure out your order. Expect if your with your loved one to have separate beds cause that's all they have. I must say you do get a balcony to chill on plus a tiny sitting area aside from your bed. Bathroom is small and kinda nasty so bring something to scrub it down with.

Checked Yelp photos for an ideas and then placed our order consisting of guacamole & chips ( amazing guac BTW ) chicken burrito , Mexican corn & steak fajitas.So the guac comes and we're excited cause it's extremely tasty but then the entrees show up and the place sank faster than the titanic. The mexi corn was horrible, it was cold and sour. My burrito was not so bad and the green sauce was fantastic but it was a below average burrito. It consisted of rice and chicken but lacked the taste bud punch needed to put a smile on my face. Now the photo of fajitas may look amazing but looks are deceiving. #1 it didn't show up on a sizzling metal plate as 99.9% serve it. Meat tasted like it had been microwaved ( I tried and spit out into napkin cause it was so bad) so it was tough and lacked that fajita taste. The veggies and meat were kinda cold so this give you an idea of why It wasn't a winner. Overall huge disappointment for Frank & guest , bummed out !",MeDuKsZcnI3IU2g7OlV-hQ

I could have but a head of lettuce and ate it for gods sake.Then my entree arrived of Kafta Plate and it tasted like recycled meatloaf from a 7-11, the worst Kafta  I've ever eaten and ketchup would have been a blessing to have around.

I know my burritos and outside of a Costco frozen burrito ranked 2nd in all time nasty burritos.Let the picture do the talking,  so folks take a big look at photo before you hand over your hard earned cash.

So now that frost bite has set in I get my sandwich, fries and coke and sit. First off the sandwich has zero taste. I'm not sure if they over cooked it or have any idea that a cheesesteak needs flavor. I sit and ponder did that use spices or bad quality meat? Maybe over cook it a little but whatever they did I must say it was a Philly Steak that tasted like  shoe leather. So here's to freezing me and showing me what an old shoe tastes like.I will not venture back to a place call Original Philly's when they can't even make the damn sandwich correctly.

For Tiki Bar standards this is the worst and violates TIKI CODE 101. Ambiance and decor is so plain I couldn't even really say this is a Tiki Bar. Sure you have a few coconuts and items trying to create a Tiki Experience, but it's truly lacking in overall decor and it shows! OMG the drinks were the worst drinks I've ever tried to consume. I took a sip of my drink hoping for tiki delights and another sip of my friends drink and we pulled an ELVIS and left the building immediately. Once sip was all it took, they were so disgusting. Touch much booze not enough balance of tropical juices & flavors that creates Bali High moment. The  bartender should learn the tiki mixology prior to serving drinks.

So we went in and bought a bunch of items to share to have a sampling of multi items for our palette. The ribs had very little meat on the bone and had tenderness of shoe leather. I have no clue how the pit master ruined there ribs but damn you get the JAMES BEARD award for worst ribs! The short rib was way over sauced and my guess is to disguise the poor cut of meat they were serving. Lady's & Gentlemen  sauce does not mean good when it's BBQ. Generally it means your a poor pit master who needs to apprentice with someone in Texas. Backyard BBQ does not mean your good. And last the chili lack meat content, I expect when I order meat chili it's stocked with meat from an animal. Let's just say my  experience was not satisfactory and I doubt by the quality of food and extremely high prices they wont stick around Scottsdale much longer.

I ordered a ribeye steak and asked medium well ( lightly pink inside) and I got a burnt hunk of meat that was not pink inside or juices or any resemblance of a prefect piece of dry aged meat. The thing was black, crunchy and like a hockey puck. Needless to say I was very disappointed and made my complaint known.  The waiter was notified and our bill was a wash since I didn't feel like waiting 30 minutes for another piece of meat to be cooked.Sad that a top notched steakhouse could not properly cook a steak.

Parking is minimal and difficult especially if your running late. Once you've entered venue you gotta cross scary bridges to seats. Now after all that, the acoustics just blow.

It tasted like they really do serve road kill verse BBQ.First off trying to find this place is a joke. It's in a neighborhood giving the indication your going to someone's backyard BBQ. Once you get there you enter this overcrowded room to order your food. People are climbing all over each other to order, and I was hit but the door at least 6 times because of overcrowding. Now while I'm waiting I watch some lady handling food with her dirty hands, BARF! So after witnessing health hazard 101, I finally get to order.. It's lunch time and I order a Dr Pepper with my meal. But guess what, these idiots don't have any chilled. Most business's have a cooler but JOHNS  BBQ blunder team just sticks the cans in ice, Except at lunch time.The food is really a 5 star disappointment. The ribs were not moist or very meaty an overly spicy to boot. Someone went heavy on the pepper rub which just added to why the ribs just sucked.. If your a rib joint then act line one and serve quality ribs. However I remembered the boil & grill their ribs verse smoke them slow & low.... You may wanna rethink your BBQ trip.

Within minutes of finishing this bowl of chili at MIKES I needed to locate another bowl ASAP if you catch my drift. Now after speaking with others about MIKES CHILI my opinion will stand because they hated it as well!Maybe you could send some to the Al-Qaeda boys in Guantanamo Bay.

Plus you had to pay for your alcohol, and when I mean pay I mean PAY. $12 for a cocktail is outrages.. Then when you get to the seats the only treats available were ( Hotdogs, Nachos & Peanuts) plus you had to pay for your booze...

8158,"For a company that had an ad that said 'Layers are for Cake' I experienced all SORTS of layers in just trying to become a patient in addition to what I perceived to be a violation of my privacy rights.What people say about the receptionist/phone staff being rude is very true.  I called to get a first time appointment with a provider.  First, I was told that the provider I requested was booked out a couple of weeks, okay fine, whatever it happens.  Then I was transferred to the 'new patient line,' and that's where things really got hairy. First, the woman I spoke with was inattentive and condescending the entire time.  When I said I wanted to be seen at the downtown location to get established as a new patient, she informed me that this was the Madison location.  I was like, ""Well, I was transferred here because I was trying to schedule a new patient appointment at the downtown location.""  JUST like I said about 4 seconds ago.  She was then like, ""Oh, we schedule new patients here.""  I was like, ""Cool."" I then learned the provider I wanted to see was booked out until December because ""she only sees 1 patient a day,"" but then I was asked if I was pregnant because that would bump me up.  While I appreciate the offer to try to get me in soon, A1- a few weeks from one person and freaking December is a big time difference, B2) Who only sees 1 patient a day?  That doesn't bode well for getting appointments in the future.  I'm sure she meant to say 1 new patient a day, but I thought to myself, 'Wow, this is not a place that's going to be able to see me quickly when I am sick.'I was still  willing to engage, so I asked, ""Okay, do you have any other female providers at the downtown location with whom I could establish care?""  She was like, ""Yes, would you prefer male or female?""  .... I was like, ""Female,"" but in my head I'm thinking, 'Uhh, I just said that, like literally just said that.'She then asked me for my date of birth, which she then read back to me incorrectly.  I had to tell her what ""number"" my month of birth was, and then, she still repeated it back incorrectly again! She asked what I wanted to schedule for, and I said 'Annual Wellness Visit' because just establishing care wasn't a good enough appointment reason, and I kind of get that.  This is where things go down hill further in the story.She then told me I needed to be more specific in my appointment choice (wth?!?!).  She was like ""Do you want just a physical, or do you need to be seen for something else?""  I explained that I'd be fine with the physical, but I also wanted to start getting my medication refills from this doctor.  So then, get this, I was told that I could not schedule an annual physical AND have my medication refilled.  I would have to pay for 2 visits.  WHAT?  I have never, ever had an appointment where I couldn't even ask my doc for refills at my first appointment.  I was like, ""So I can't start getting my meds at a physical exam?"" and then she launched into a reason why insurance wouldn't pay for both things in one appointment, which is a total load of crap.  TOTAL BS. It's a money scheme.At this point, I had spent an inordinate amount of time on the phone with a condescending woman who wouldn't even listen to me, so I was like 'Okay, I can push through and just finish this, maybe the doctor is good.' So then, I asked, ""Well, if I have to schedule 2 separate appointments, can I schedule them back to back.""  She was like ""No, you have to schedule the appointments separately."" Um, yeah, I get that, that's why I asked for 2 appointments back to back, instead of being snarky, like I wanted to, I replied, ""Yeah, so could I get one of those appointments like at 1:30 and the other at 2?""  She then launched into another lecture about insurance not paying/recognizing that in a louder, even more condescending tone.  At this point, I was done, so, I said, ""This process seems complicated, so I'd prefer to go elsewhere, thank you for your time."" During the whole time I'm trying to get this out, the phone person was trying to talk over me rudely, STILL going on about why you can't have med refills and a physical in the same visit (which is COMPLETE BS from an insurance standpoint).And then, wait for it, SHE CALLED ME BACK; SHE FREAKING CALLED ME BACK after I said I didn't want to go receive care at the Polyclinic.  I was like, um, no, and rejected the call.THEN SHE LEFT A VOICEMAIL with specific details about the appointment type I had requested.  Keep in mind, I didn't even consent to care at this medical facility, but she accessed/used my personal phone number and then left a non-HIPAA compliant voicemail on a number that I hadn't even given permission to leave detailed information, all of this AFTER I said I didn't want to go there!

So, I said, pour over was fine.  Then, before even starting my pour over, she did drinks for about 3-5 other people.  At that point, I said I'd just take Pike roast because I had waited at least 15 minutes for a mobile order.  I didn't even get an, ""I'm sorry.""  Keep in mind, this is one of MANY stories I could tell that expresses a similar theme).  Even when I order a beverage that isn't drip, it's always slow and often times wrong.No other Starbucks in Seattle has been like this for me.  Normally, Starbucks baristas are super fast, but it's like the hiring manager at this store doesn't know how to hire acceptable staff.  All of my friends in this area complain about this Starbucks and rank it as one of the worst.If you have another coffee option in this area, take it.",WoeLzkLB1WkLG24AVfOfJg

The place is withing reasonable walking distance to the beach.Bad things- The food was NOT good except for 1 night with a buffet.  Apparently there is some culinary school that is connected with this place, but I don't think the students are getting their money's worth out of their tuition.  Some of the food was so bad a that everyone at our table left most of it on the plate.  The accommodations aren't cheap or very nice, but then, get this, THEY ASK YOU FOR MONEY!  They call it ""estate planning"" and asked many, many times during the conference for people to donate to their ""ministry.""  Seriously, in a regular, non-conference market, you couldn't charge what they charged for these rooms during non-peak season.  Seriously, you charge that much AND expect people to donate more money?  Um, no.  Additionally, they have a lot of volunteer labor for cleaning so I am not sure why we were repeatedly asked to subsidize the cost of this establishment.  Maybe if the rooms were coming at a cheap rate, sure, but they're clearly not charging under a regular rate, so why do they need more money?  The sink in our room dripped so much we had to turn off the water, and it was very much like staying at a summer camp or dorm. The bed was super uncomfortable.There is also no alcohol allowed, which is really dumb, especially because you can walk right across the street to get a beer or wine, so I am not sure what they are trying to accomplish with this. If you're looking for a church retreat, I'd look elsewhere.  You can do better for less and not have your people solicited for money.",WoeLzkLB1WkLG24AVfOfJg
8210,"Poor selection and poor service= this location in my experience.  Each time I have been here has been a disappointment, and I only go because I am hoping they might have what I need so I don't have to drive elsewhere.  Service-  I have never once been greeted or even had eye contact made with me by an employee each time I have come here.  A simple, ""Hey"" when I walk in would be nice.  When I actually have to search for an employee, I get the vibe that my question is an inconvenience even though this place is never busy.  I have also had the experience that when I ask about an item, I'll get an ""I don't know"" without an offer to even go check or ask another employee.  Selection- I am always surprised with what they don't have for a sporting goods store.  They have very generic items, but if you want something specific or a specific brand,- skip this place because they probably don't have it.  If you want a Seahawks shirt, you will find one.  However, if you want #25 Sherman jersey, they won't have it.  If you want an air mattress for camping, they have those.  However, if you want a self-inflating camping mat, you won't find that.  Again- general items are here, but they are more shallow in their selection like a restaurant that tries to do Asian, Italian, and Mexican food all in the same place.",WoeLzkLB1WkLG24AVfOfJg

Typically, I don't update reviews of businesses that I give a second chance to and have continuously bad experiences. However one of the owners, Amanda , in her comments on my review, chalked up my experience to Burger Boss being new; I wanted to share additional feedback because the problems I experienced after were the same old slowness time after time.The second time I went back, I ordered another cheeseburger.  I waited about 15 minutes for it and the place was not crowded. Again, the burger was cold, but at least it had cheese on it this time.The third time I went back to Burger Boss, I just ordered a shake. How bad could a shake be? How long could it take with only 1 other order before me? The shake was mostly melted because I waited so long, and the other person had waited so long for their food that they left even though they had already paid.  This visit was in October.3 strikes,  Burger Boss is out. :(",WoeLzkLB1WkLG24AVfOfJg
8244,"Oh, Ross.  Some Ross stores are great, and some are not so great.  This one is firmly in the not so great category.Service- Awful.  I expect to wait in line at Ross, but they had 2 cashiers on a Saturday.  2.  WTF?  Additionally, there was one associate who loudly claimed, ""I just can't handle checking people out anymore today; they're driving me nuts.""  Then, the person proceeded to distract other sales associates with her complaining.  I get that retail is a tough gig, but sometimes, you don't always get to pick what you want to do, especially when a line is as deep as this one.  The manager began checking people out, but he did nothing to call additional help (and there were other associates that were VERY available). The manager who was checking out was pretty slow, but the woman who was checking with him was great.  She was fast and apologized for the wait- something the manager guy didn't do at all.  I am giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 solely because of her, the light in a dark, godless place.Selection- The place was really picked over.  I know most Ross stores have a variety of great and not so great selection days, but the place was a mess.  Again, then thing that I keep going back to is that there were available associates to do stuff, but they were busy chatting or on their cell phones.I will definitely be back to Ross, but not this one.",WoeLzkLB1WkLG24AVfOfJg

8260,"I wanted a new coffee place near my work; I wanted it to be Coffee Tree.  You can't always get what you want, as the great prophets, The Rolling Stones, have told us.  I have to give the caveat that this place isn't bad.  The coffee wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't good.  I am typically a black coffee girl, but I wanted a floofy drink, so I went for a raspberry mocha frapp.  I was hoping it was the greatest frapp of my life (it wasn't), and here is why:The service- BOO!  Kat L. said it best when she mentioned that Seattle is full of awesome baristas, but it seems like Coffee Tree has people that just don't care.  It took at least 10 minutes to get my drink, and the place wasn't busy.  I was the ONLY person in line with maybe 2-3 other people in the joint.  I can have a line of 7 people at Starbucks and get it faster.  What's more, it's like I was an inconvenience to the person behind the counter for even asking to order something.  When the guy was making the drink, he was kind of wandering around aimlessly, no hustle.  I don't expect a 20 second turnaround time, but, I shouldn't have to wait that long to just get a drink.  The drink itself was average, and the sweet was really overpowering.  The raspberry part of the drink was nonexistent, and I wasn't even sure there was even coffee in there.On a good note, I DO like that they are all about using compostable items and the environment, but geez, they need to step it up if they want to say in business in a place like Seattle.",WoeLzkLB1WkLG24AVfOfJg

8269,"Meh...but where else are you going to go in the bustling metropolis of Union, WA when you don't want to drive to Olympia? Service-  Jenni J.'s review saved my butt; Yelpers save the day once again!!  Had I not seen her post about the manager guy accosting you when you walk in the door about having a reservation, I wouldn't have gotten one before going here.  It isn't even made apparent on their website that a reservation is more than a recommendation; that kind of hacked me off.  Say on the website that you NEED a reservation, not that you CAN get one.  Information fail!  We sat in the pub, and for the first 30- 45 minutes of our visit, the poor bartender was taking care of the bar and doing all of the waiting in the area.  The bartender did a nice job, but he was just busy, which is a staffing issue, not a bad service issue, and it took a while to even order.  In order of priority, I would say having your restaurant adequately staffed is greater than than freaking out about reservations for a mostly empty restaurant.  Once the bartender had backup, the service was pretty good, and my glass stayed full.Food/Drinks- my husband and I had several items:Mac and Cheese-  Meh. It was more like a cheese soup that happened to have macaroni in it.  Both parts were good, but the dish didn't blend together well.  It's like two people dancing, but they are near one another and each person is kind of doing its own thing.  I would have been happy with the cheese part, which had exceptional flavor, but it wasn't good Mac AND Cheese.  The value of teamwork, people!Fish and chips with shoestring fries- Really good!  I was impressed.  The consistency of both the fish and the fries were great.  The panko on the outside of the fish wasn't overly greasy and was well seasoned.  The fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.Sweet potato fries- excellent.  Perfect size, and great consistency.  The outside was crispy and just a tad flaky, while the inside was well done, but not overdone.  These were some of the best sweet potato fries I have had in a while.Onion rings- meh.  Not bad, but nothing to write home about.Burger- meh.  Again, not bad, but I expect more from the price tag on it (just like Kevin B. said in his review).  No bad things, but it just wasn't that great.  The flavor was good, but buns made for far too much bread.Drinks- meh.  Cocktail was overly sweet, ginger beer wasn't awesome, wine was average for price point.Dessert- We had they key lime pie, but my hopes were a bit dashed on the rocks.  I could purchase better at a grocery store.  Again, nothing was really bad, but not really that good.  A lot of people had raved about the desserts, but I found the key lime pie to be decidedly meh.Decor-  Very cute!  This is probably the best part of this place.  It's really neat.  They have all sorts of decorative old books, and it really does have a London pub feel.I love Union, WA, but when I go back, I don't think I will come here again.  It was too pricey for what it was.  If Olympia was 15 minutes closer, this place would go out of business.",WoeLzkLB1WkLG24AVfOfJg

8300,"This review is based only on the drinks and service. Our group got seated at a booth. The decor and ambiance was pretty cool and trendy. When the server came to take our drink order, I had asked her what the Whiteclaw drink was listed under the Beer, Wine, etc. section of the menu. She had told me that it was like a cider that was a little sweet with a hint of grapefruit. That piqued my interest so I ordered that. When she brought our drinks, she placed a really tall can in front of me. I was pretty surprised and wasn't expecting a can, but it was fine. When I took my first sips, I barely tasted anything. I turned the can around to see the front side and noticed at the bottom it said, ""Sparkling water with a hint of grapefruit"". I was pretty confused and bummed out. I wasn't really sure why she would tell me that the Whiteclaw drink was cider. Cider and sparkling water are two very different drinks. I kept sipping and just tried to enjoy it since it was a huge $10 can. But after a few minutes, I decided to order some wine so I can actually enjoy myself. When a different server came to check up on us, my boyfriend asked if I could get the Anderson Valley Rosé. The server told us that that isn't actually a rosé but a completely different kind of drink. It was confusing, but they do actually have a rosé on the menu, which we ordered, but it's not the Anderson Valley drink listed on the menu. When our original server stopped by, she noticed I had the rosé and wasn't drinking my Whiteclaw sparkling water. She asked, ""Did you not like it?"". I said, ""no, not really."" And all she said was, ""Well I like it."" and walked away. Had she told me that it was sparkling water, I definitely wouldn't have ordered that and waste $10. Maybe this was just one of those off-chance, bad experiences. Maybe the food is good? The space is definitely pretty cool to hang with friends after dinner or for happy hour. Not sure if I'd return. There's a lot of other bars that have less confusing drink menus and better service that I would prefer going to.",KbU6Q0oy5X2mTShnRXiggg
8302,"I really wanted to like this place because I was in need of a relaxing massage. I also don't enjoy giving businesses such a low rating. But there were several things that I feel, justifies the 2 star rating. Earlier that morning, I booked a couples massage online requesting for a 4pm time slot. Q Sauna & Spa was very quick to respond and said instead of 4pm, they would like us to come at 4:15pm. We arrived at the spa just before 4:15pm. Upon check-in, the receptionist told us that because we did not come 20-30 minutes prior to our appointment time to prepare for the massage (change and explore the spa), we will not be able to start our massage appointment until 4:40pm. I double checked the email that they had sent me to confirm the appointment time, and I did not see anything saying that we should come early. Luckily we were fairly flexible on time, so having our massage at 4:40pm was ok. We were both each given our own locker keys and spa clothing (top and shorts) to wear around the facility. After we both changed, we walked around and explored the different types of rooms they have to offer. The facility was very clean and peaceful. After checking out the different rooms, we headed to the massage therapy area to wait for our appointment. When it was time to head into our appointment, they had directed each of us to our own massage rooms. Immediately, we asked if we were not going to be in the same room because we had booked a couples massage. I'm not really sure what the reasoning was because I couldn't really hear the woman clearly, but I guess there was another appointment still going on in the room that had 2 massage beds. So that was bummer. Once I got into my room, the masseuse instructed me to undress, cover myself with a sheet that was provided on the massage table, and lay face down. Once I was settled onto the massage table, I noticed that the masseuse didn't close the room door. I've had many massages in the past at both massage therapy clinics and hotel spas. This was the first time I've been in a massage room where they didn't close the door. Because my room door was open, I didn't feel fully relaxed being practically naked and being worked on as people walked by my room. There was also a point during the first 10 minutes of the massage where I was adjusting my head and I noticed someone walk into the room to get something, then walk out. That was a bit uncomfortable. For the first 10-15 minutes or so, the masseuse pressed on my back, arms, and legs, with the sheet still over me, in a very rough manner. At first I thought, maybe she's relaxing my muscles before she starts? But after a while, I thought maybe the entire massage was going to be this way because she was doing this for a while. She then rolled the sheet down to expose my back and dripped some oil on my skin. Once she started massaging, I immediately knew that the Swedish couples massage that I had requested, wasn't going to be that. I'm not really sure what that was, but it definitely didn't feel like a relaxing massage. I've heard stories about Korean spas and that they can be pretty rough while doing the popular Korean body scrub. But because I wanted to alleviate some stress and feel relaxed, I purposely booked an appointment for a Swedish massage.Unfortunately, the entire massage experience was very rough with fast, and painful movements. There were times during the massage where her nails would dig into my back, which was pretty painful and uncomfortable. When I was facing up, it seemed like she was using her knuckles on my shin bone, which was pretty sore. Once she got to my head, she pressed pretty hard near my eye sockets, which I did not enjoy at all. And towards the ending of the head massage, she had placed her fingers into my ears and pulled very hard. Once I got home I researched Swedish massage techniques to see if it was similar to the service we got at Q Sauna & Spa. Unfortunately, what we had was very different from what I had found online. Also, their Couples Escape Suite Experience description is very misleading. It says, ""Enjoy a special moment together while enjoying a Swedish or Acupressure massage in the same room with the therapist who will use customized to each individual's needs."" I thought that before the massage would start, like at other spas I've been to, the masseuse would ask what level of pressure I prefer (light to medium), and fine tune  things based on my personal needs. But once the masseuse entered the room, she just began to do her thing. My experience at Q Sauna & Spa wasn't enjoyable. I'm sure their other services like the body scrub and their masks are probably really good. Also their amenities seemed really nice and something you should take advantage of. But if you're looking for a relaxing and soothing massage, I would probably recommend going to Elaia in downtown Seattle or another spa that offers relaxing massages.",KbU6Q0oy5X2mTShnRXiggg
8378,"I hate to give this place such a low rating. But after what I saw the last time I ate here, I have to say that I'm extremely disappointed. Went for lunch with my boyfriend and some friends on Presidents Day after the Great Aloha Run. Sat near the counter where we could see drinks being made. Everything was great for the most part. Food was just as delicious as the last two times that I was here. However, this time I got completely grossed out after my boyfriend and my other friend had pointed out that the food/drink handling wasn't as sanitary as it should be. They had pointed out that an employee who was wearing gloves touched money and credit cards and then touched food and made drinks using the same pair of gloves. The person didn't bother to take off the gloves that they touched money with and change to a new pair. So we all just sat at our table watching this person make a number of Bloody Mary's and other drinks as well as grabbed baked goods using the same exact gloves that touched cash and customers credit cards. Maybe it was our dumb luck that we got seated there and witnessed that. Otherwise, our whole dining experience would've been great. But that's what the four of us saw and got grossed out by. Don't get me wrong, the food is great especially the BLT Benny.

It wasn't busier than an average coffee shop is and we placed our order and I sat down.Now my colleagues' order was received in a timely manner. I watched my pour over and they take time. It was done and we were getting ready to leave......but the barista left it in the mason jar. And he forgot about it......for over ten minutes. Fine, people forget, mistakes happen.What happened next was unbelievable. The barista tried to serve me my coffee after it had been sitting there for over ten minutes. Seriously? He only offered to remake it after I informed him that I wasn't happy he let it sit out so long.

It set the bar a little low for the rest of the experience.After that we each got a brisket flatbread and a brisket sandwich. In my case, the sandwich was oversauced and it wasn't pleasant. The sauce wasn't even good to begin with. My acquaintance had similar grievances about the flatbread.I figured that the fire roasted potato salad would make up for it. I love potato salad. I was definitely wrong. That was another disappointing aspect of the meal. Neither of us liked anything about it.It gets two stars because our server didn't do a single thing wrong.

I liked the gravy and it was a decent experience.So why the 1 star? Unfortunately, I got food poisoning and spent the next few days recovering. While it's easy to question how I got so sick, it comes down to this having been the only thing I'd eaten all day.

I know this is an established place up in Longmont.I'll start off with the part I was oddly, most upset about. They don't offer their craft soda? I mean, have you tried Oskar Blues' black cherry soda? It is amazing! Even if the meal was average, at least the soda would have made up for it.The best part was the burger though. I did enjoy the actually burger patty itself. First time, you have to try their signature burger and I did. While it might be a bit high ($8) in price for a fast casual, I think it did the job.  The fries were pretty average though.I think the purpose of this place is to focus specifically on their beer.

That's fine, I know a pour over takes about 5 minutes and there were people ahead of me.I sat down and waited, patiently. Then waited and waited. After a while I noticed that people were getting their order.....people that showed up after me.I decided to start counting. One, two.....thirteen. Yup, 13 people (who ordered after me) received their drink before me. I can't for the life of me understand why you would do that? Drinks are to be made in the order they were received.I waited exactly 32 minutes from the moment I checked in for my drink. They completely threw off my entire morning and never even apologized or offered an explanation.I considered that maybe the barista didn't know how to do a pour over, but he did someone else's. So yes, they literally skipped over me many times and never offered an explanation. Coffee wasn't that great anyway.Usually I give coffee roasters a second or third chance, but this place doesn't deserve one. Don't go here",o5idGYF_nt2H3cADASi2YA
8453,"Hate being the person to do this but this wasn't very goodI went one evening when the wait at the Yard House was too long and ordered things from meatballs to pizza and none of it was good.Much of the food we received came to us lukewarm and just didn't taste very good. Our server told us they were famous for their wings which were highly disappointing.Not sure anything we had was good. My colleague was in complete agreement that it probably wasn't really worth the trip.I'd love to say something positive.....our waitress was nice....but that's probably the extent of it. I think maybe they're still in the process of being new, but I wouldn't recommend it",o5idGYF_nt2H3cADASi2YA
8454,"It always pains me to rate any place so low, especially a coffee roaster.So this takes me back to something a friend of mine (and coffee roaster) once said. If you're roasting for a small town, people like their coffee dark. I'm guessing that there probably isn't a market for craft coffee in Loveland, so the Coffee Tree is better suited with darker roasts of their coffee.My issue comes with them not offering a single manual brew method. If you're putting effort into roasting your own beans, the least you can do is allow people something other than a batch brew.The other issue came with hearing that they dark roast a Yirgacheffe. Why? Back to the small town thing I guess, but it wasn't great. Perhaps it was overly ambitious of me to think I'd be able to find another Evocation (Amarillo) in a small town, but this wasn't great. I'm sure they do a fine job of everything else",o5idGYF_nt2H3cADASi2YA
8472,Well this was a major disappointment.Quick context about this place. I used to watch Shark Tank and I remember this episode very well. It sounded cool and I passed it by during the lunch break at my first day of work. I wanted to go in but decided to wait figuring it'd be a pretentious hipster grilled cheese place with overpriced items. I came across the menu at work and knew I had to try it.Disappointment. Utter disappointment.We'll start with the service. It did take almost my entire lunch break to get my food (and it wasn't even that busy). Worker morale seemed somewhat low.The design of the restaurant? It's like a chuck-e-cheese. Very kid-like. They probably want it to be a family establishment but it seemed awkward to me. The food itself? Well the first few bites were great! A mac n' cheese sandwich? Neat! But I really couldn't eat any more after that. It just was not really warm enough and was boring.It gets that 2nd star for creativity and an okay product. I just wouldn't recommend it.,o5idGYF_nt2H3cADASi2YA
8478,"Well this was disappointing.Came here on my lunch break since it had such good reviews and ordered a calzone. I waited and waited and watched the people that ordered 10 minutes after me get their food while I continued to wait. Waiting for my calzone took up my entire lunch break.The calzone itself, nothing special. Giant and filled with a bunch of different meats, but still a little underwhelming. I think there's little knock on the food, but it definitely wasn't worth waiting for an eternity. It's such a shame this place didn't live up to the hype given its proximity to my work. Definitely would not recommend.",o5idGYF_nt2H3cADASi2YA
8510,"So I went here one night with a bunch of my friends and I'd love to let you know how anything here was.....if any of us were even served. We all tried getting the attention of any of the staff, utter failure.I see so many other complaining about the service and they are completely right. I don't know if it has changed since, but none of us have ever felt as ignored as we did that night. It's actually a really reassuring that so many other have the same grievances that we did.So I kinda get it; it's unique, it's busy and it's loud. But still, the gimmick and appeal of it is not worth the insanely bad level of service.",o5idGYF_nt2H3cADASi2YA
8516,"Pretty unfortunate that this went from a Good Times to a Los Arcos given how it is pretty subpar. I got pretty excited when it opened since it is closer than any Santiago's, but it is definitely not Santiago's.Their green chili is actually fine. It's not award-winning quality or something you rave about, it is basically the bottom-tier of acceptability. That's pretty much where the good ends.I got sick eating here a few times. Not overly sick, but the feeling of eating McDonalds a week straight. I tried quite a few things from tamales to breakfast burritos and I just don't think it's really worth it even for cheap Mexican food.",o5idGYF_nt2H3cADASi2YA
8517,"I always felt that this place doesn't really care that their food isn't great but that's not really what they are going for. Champa tends to get very busy because they have some of the cheapest alcohol you'll find at any restaurant.I've tried their burgers before and they were pretty poor in general. I've tried quite a few things on the menu before resigning to the fact that it's better to eat before or after I go here. They used to do $1 beers on Wednesdays before upping the price to $1.50. Not a big deal, but you're gambling on the selection.There are nights where they are fully stocked and you have a great selection, but there have also been nights where I couldn't find anything desirable to drink. The main draw of this place is it's dirt cheap alcohol, but I don't really drink much anymore so that's not really appealing.If you're looking for quality food, this isn't the place. If you're looking for cheap beer and below average/overpriced food, this is the place!",o5idGYF_nt2H3cADASi2YA
8519,"I'm going to ignore the terrible service for a second and comment on the atrocity of their food. I went with a friend and they had a case of eyes being bigger than their mouth so they ordered everything on the menu. Uhm, not one thing was good.Spinach dip was bad, wings were awful and the pizza was worst of all (think worse than microwave pizza). I know we ordered quite a few more things and none of it was even passable. I don't understand why anyone eats here. It's not like the prices are great for the quality of food you're getting.I do legitimately think this is the worst dining experience I've ever had. Let's add in the pretty mediocre service and general dead atmosphere and it's a wonder how they're still in business. I think a major overhaul needs to be made but, even then, it'd take a miracle for me to even considering trying it again.",o5idGYF_nt2H3cADASi2YA
8534,"All hype?I've gone to Boxcar once or twice every year on the rare occasion that I'm actually in Boulder and I've never really figured this place out. It was so hyped the first time I went with a colleague and neither of us left happy. In fact, he quoted it as, ""the worst cup of coffee he has ever had.""I'm definitely not going that far, but I've given it a few more chances. I get that they make all their drip coffee on the spot in front of you, nice gimmick, but that doesn't mean it's any more enjoyable. Both the latte and drip were definitely not as good as advertised. Maybe that's a result of high expectations?There are quite a few coffee shops in Boulder. I'm definitely going to skip this one next time I'm there.",o5idGYF_nt2H3cADASi2YA
8541,"This Santiago's shows what loyalty gets you, nothing.I've been going to this Santiago's for 10 years when I first started high school and they were located closer to the rec center. Most of those days me and my friends were the only ones there but we loved it and they had a group of regulars.Guess what? They moved closer to the school. Typically great news except the customer service didn't come along with it. 6 months ago I waited (and I timed it) exactly 67 minutes for two burritos and I walked out again today because it took them 30 minutes and I hadn't even ordered yet. Instead, I see a women cut in front of me because ""they know her"" as we're all disgusted that they let her order even though she just arrived. Foolish me, never should have given them a second chance.I'll take my business to the Lakewood or Arvada locations because the longer drive saves you half an hour anyway. Disappointed and disgusted by these people. I was there when things weren't so great and brought them new business and had been loyal for 10 years. Too bad they couldn't do the same for me. I will NEVER be back. Thanks for nothing",o5idGYF_nt2H3cADASi2YA
8547,"Are all Macaroni grills this bad?The negative aspects of it included the lukewarm temperature to everything. Our tapas were bordering on cold, my entree was barely warm, the meatballs had a funny texture/taste to them, and the taste was relatively poor. The place looks nice and people are dressed well but the food was downright awful.Our waiter was good. He seemed to be trying very hard so that was one of the reasons it got two starts. The other being that the hostess was very pretty",o5idGYF_nt2H3cADASi2YA
8549,"I tried the LTO Burger and Fries Special and my brother customized his burger, we were both really unhappy with the results. The fries and sauce were both good, almost as good as HBurger but the burger was no better then something from Carl's Jr. White cheddar as opposed to regular cheddar? That did not go over well with my brother who did deem this ""the worst burger ever."" I thought that was a bit harsh but I honestly have had better burgers from places that aren't known for their burgers like Applebees, Chili's, BWW. The inside is nice and their house beer was good but overall, not a good burger. We agreed on the spot that we wouldn't be coming back any time soon.",o5idGYF_nt2H3cADASi2YA
8664,"I came here late at night and got seated right away. The customer service here was good, very friendly and speedy. The food is something I would not recommend. To me, there are plenty of other ramen places in Seattle and near here that taste much better. I ordered their Prawn Miso Ramen and their gyoza. The gyoza was good, but then again, I've never had horrible gyoza. The soup though was very salty and the noodles were bland. Sadly, this place is somewhere that I would never want to eat at again and was bummed to even pay for a meal that was so disappointing.",loIgOJbwgu0b8nW8DcVG8w
8680,"I've tried 3 different pizza slices from here and only enjoyed 1 of those slices. I was definitely disappointed with the pizza here, after having it recommended from some friends. The slices I ordered were: spinach & garlic, mushroom, and a special that had sausage and red peppers. The special pizza was the only that was good, yet still nothing spectacular. The garlic & spinach pizza slices were overly crunchy and burnt on the bottom. The crust was extremely hard to eat because it was overly cooked. There's just so many pizza places in Seattle, that I'm unsure if I would come back here unless I was already in Ballard.",loIgOJbwgu0b8nW8DcVG8w
8694,"I came here on a Friday night and sat at the bar with my boyfriend. We were served pretty fast and just ordered Dos Equis Amber along with flautas. The flautas were just okay. They were truly taquitos because they were skinny and not fat like a flauta. The overall taste was just okay too. I would probably come back here just to get beer, but I'm unsure if I would want to try their food again.",loIgOJbwgu0b8nW8DcVG8w
8698,"I came here to do some work on my computer and needed a place in Renton with wi-fi. I'm definitely a coffee snob and do not typically like coffee chains at all, so I was hoping that this place brewed their own coffee. It turns out that they use Peet's Coffee...a place that I have never liked. Nonetheless, I still ordered a coffee drink here and didn't like it all.",loIgOJbwgu0b8nW8DcVG8w
8715,"I've had Stoup's Citra IPA at a bar before and was excited to visit Stoup Brewing. When I came here, I decided to try 2 different beers. I ordered their Mosaic Pale Ale and the Good Livin' IPA. Both were disappointments to both me and my boyfriend. Sadly, I don't plan on coming back here.",loIgOJbwgu0b8nW8DcVG8w
8722,"Me and my boyfriend went here on a Saturday morning around 8am. We got seated right away. When it comes to customer service, this place was great. We got helped right away and the servers were very friendly. What I didn't enjoy about this place was the food itself. To me, it was definitely over-priced for what you get...mainly because both of our breakfasts didn't taste good. I ordered the Joe's Scramble. Overall, the scramble was okay, it had more cheese than I would have liked. It also came with roasted potatoes that were soggy and a piece of toast that was super hard and tasteless. My boyfriend ordered the Sandra's Breakfast Burrito. I think the burrito would have tasted better without the sauce. Their version of a ranchero sauce uses Theo's dark chocolate and for a person that likes chocolate, I thought the sauce tasted absolutely disgusting. Overall, our food experience was so bad, that I don't intend on ever coming back here.",loIgOJbwgu0b8nW8DcVG8w
8736,"I've been to Boudin in SF and the location located in Irvine and have received good food, but this one was a disappointment. I came here around normal lunch time and ordered their Turkey Avocado sandwich with mixed greens. The sandwich itself was okay, nothing special. The mixed greens is what I found disappointing. It was basically a sad excuse for a salad. The mixed greens salad was an assortment of mixed greens with just some balsamic vinaigrette on it. I expected there to also be vegetables along with the salad. I'll admit with Boudin, I just had higher expectations in a salad from them. I don't intend on coming back here.",loIgOJbwgu0b8nW8DcVG8w
8767,"Was in dire need of coffee before work, so luckily this spot is literally across the street from work. I ordered a hot Caffe Latte. It was definitely pretty good for a chain coffee place. I enjoyed the ""velvet foam"" on top of my latte. I'm not a fan of chain coffee stores at all, but I think this is a solid place.Updated: April 2017; came here again and ordered the same Caffe Latte. It tasted horrible. I am now scared to retry this place again because of the inconsistency.",loIgOJbwgu0b8nW8DcVG8w
8783,"I'm always excited to try out different coffee shops, especially when they're located a few blocks away. I went here on a Saturday morning to start off my day. I ordered a regular latte and my boyfriend ordered their iced Americano. Now, we are both avid coffee drinkers and typically drink our coffees ""black"". We both have also had several other coffees from other places in Seattle, so we are used to the stronger coffee available in Seattle. But this place was just WAY too strong. I realized my latte had 2 shots of espresso and my boyfriend's Americano had 4 shots of espresso. That truly is just madness! We both ended up just throwing out our coffees because we disliked it that much. Bedlam Coffee is actually the first coffee shop that I dislike in Seattle and was definitely let down since most people rave about this place. I definitely won't be recommending this place to anyone.",loIgOJbwgu0b8nW8DcVG8w
8839,"I've always loved the Lion & Rose and frequent the one located in Alamo Heights, but I don't ever plan on coming back to this location. I came here with some friends on a Saturday night and we sat down at the bar. When we initially sat down, I asked the waitress ""Do you have any beer on cask?"" I'm not bothered by the fact that she didn't know what that was, but her response. She simply told me in a rude manner ""I have no idea what you're talking about"" and just walked away. She never bothered to ask any of us what we wanted to drink and helped other guests before us. Also, under her breath I did overhear her say ""Ugh, I don't want to deal with these people"". Basically, it was just rude customer service. It would have been fine to just say, ""I'm sorry we don't have that, but is there something else you would like?""All in all, my rating is low due to service of one lady bartender. Pretty bummed, since I've always been a fan of the Lion & Rose even when it was open in the Stone Oak area on Sonterra.",loIgOJbwgu0b8nW8DcVG8w
8861,"Went here the other day to grab some drinks. Overall, walking in the place has a cool vibe. They play primarily reggae music and have about 50 beers on tap that is listed on a screen with the price and alcohol percentage. The downside of this place is their cleanliness, service, and beer knowledge. We went there and everyone ordered the Ballast Point Grunion Pale Ale. When we drank it though, we knew it wasn't the actual beer and the bartender insisted that it was. Lucky for us, we were with a Ballast Point distributor so he looked at the tap and confirmed that it in fact wasn't the beer we had requested. The service was highly lacking. There was one lady working and maybe 10 at most people in the place. But it was fairly calm, yet she didn't walk around to ask us if we need more after our empty glasses sat there for over 15 minutes. As for cleanliness, the toilet paper and paper towels were empty in the restroom. Also, there was a pile of looks like swept up trash just sitting on the ground near a table. Sadly, I wish this place was better, but I don't see myself coming back.",loIgOJbwgu0b8nW8DcVG8w
8927,"I feel funny rating this place low and it's mainly because I think the food quality isn't that amazing. Yes, it's better than Olive Garden, but I could personally cook the meal I ordered.

8953,"Stayed here for a weekend getaway because of its great location. The hotel grounds itself is beautiful, great for events like parties and weddings.The room had a good view of the ocean. Some reasons for only 2 stars are as follows:1. Stains found on the outdoor lawn chairs.2. Broken closet door. 3. Broken drawer where the safe lock is.4. Biggest con: no first aid kit at the swimming pool. My boyfriend cut his toe on one of the lights inside the pool and the guy working at the pool just gave him a napkin rather than a band-aid.I'm hesitant to say if I would come here again.

I expressed that the other sub is for a handicapped person in a wheelchair. She simply told me ""I already told you, it is 1 per customer"".I would have been fine if she just said ""sorry but unfortunately we can't do that"" but instead she was super rude.

We got multiple items including Cajun beef, paprika salmon, and Cajun tuna. The Cajun beef was tasty. I liked the paprika salmon but their salmon is more fishy tasting than other places. Also tried some fried rolls. Overall I was impresses with the creativity of the sushi rolls but I do thnk Sake 2 Me is much better in quality.",loIgOJbwgu0b8nW8DcVG8w
8994,"I give one star to this place for being creative about their tea/juice/slushie concoctions. I got a honeydew milk tea with boba, which was okay. I like how the boba was soft, but personally I think that the drink itself was more milk tea tasting with hardly any of the honeydew taste. I also ordered spring rolls, which I did enjoy. Comes along with a good and simple peanut sauce.The reason I rated this place so low is the customer service. I was seated promptly with a menu, but then waited a good 15 minutes before I decided to ask one of the waiters to take my order because they failed to do that. I was there for an hour and that whole hour nobody came by to my table to ask how the food was or if they could get me anything...even though they asked other people. When I was done, I actually held up my credit card hoping it would get attention, but nope. Basically, everyone else in the restaurant got helped instead of me. Not sure if it's because I was the only Filipino in a Vietnamese restaurant. But I sure felt invisible compared to everyone else in the restaurant.",loIgOJbwgu0b8nW8DcVG8w

When I picked it up, they didn't give me a receipt. I ended up not needing it after fixing the issue myself, and went to return the part 10 days later. When I arrived, I was shown to the parts manager who immediately told me no returns happen after 5 days after the part arrives. I told him that not only would it have been nice to know this when I ordered it, but to have been told when I picked it up. He said it was policy, on the receipt I signed and that I was ""sh*t out of luck"", then he told me to leave, he had a real customer to help. Apalled and offended, I waited outside when a nice lady came up and said she would take care of it. After she gave me a refund minus$ 10 shipping and %20 restocking fee, which I was happy to pay in the first place, I said ""I don't know if he was having a bad day or something, but the way he treated me was totally unacceptable."" Her response was ""you know we aren't even supposed to return this so be happy with what you got, and you should probably just leave:"" This is how you treat customers at a family run business?

It was like trying to keep sand in a strainer how all the minced pork pieces and veggies fell out. there was no flavoring and again, in near tears of hunger, i was let down.Not that I wouldn't try it again for a second chance, my first experience here was just such a let down that i would need a friend(?) to drag me there and pay for it.",uyD3PwCbTm8nuP-z6a_EQg

They also do a good job of getting gigs for small local bands.The Bad:- It is in the middle of rapist-ville with dark alleys, rickety train tracks, and abandon warehouses for blocks. - Don't leave your car here overnight, or it will be the last time you see it in its present condition or at all.- The staff are pretentious and treat the performers and their crew like they are the ones doing the band a favor.- The management are unreliable and stingy when it comes to paying bands for their crowd draw and work.- The seating and viewing arrangements are piss-poor. You couldn't find a comfy booth to watch from if there was no one standing at all. And the bar has one row of space for railing view, which is like looking down from the roof of a building onto the stage. And the speakers are not pointed well enough to project the sound there either.The Good:- The light system is nicely designed for the small stage.- Many local bands can play here and have a decent live show.- there is plenty of room for the crowd, it is rarely packed shoulder to shoulder unless a well known band is playing.All in all it is a good local venue, but not somewhere you should expect to make a good wad performing, or where you should expect an epic show.

We ordered two orders of tacos which were fine as well as two beers. We asked which beers were on draft- three options including the modelo we chose. We asked if there was the happy hour special that is plastered all over their promotional materials to which we were met with a scoff and ""no"" (okay, after USC games should be displayed on these ads). After our first beer we decided that it would be best to get a pitcher to be cost effective. The waitress told us that modelo pitchers were the only options available after asking for a drink list. How this makes sense I'm not sure- as we were presented initially with three options for draft beers. After being told that's the only option at $25 we declined. We were weary of other yelpers and the 18% gratuity so we decided to take our business elsewhere. We received the check which listed each of our beers at $9 a piece - this is also different than what is listed online.

Overall a great place though- id be back for specials only otherwise I'd pass. Should be mentioned We also had pretzels and fries which were forgettable but the drink specials kept us here all night.",3B88XMVFwWVA9hvumgU2Xg
9157,"This was one of the few restaurants open in SLU on the 4th of July, so we stopped in to pick up a quick dinner before walking over to the firework show. I ordered a bacon fried rice and a vietnamese coffee. WARNING: DO NOT GET THE VIETNAMESE COFFEE. I don't know what they were thinking, but it tasted more like chocolate milk. I'm pretty sure they put Hershey's chocolate syrup at the bottom of the cup, it was gross. The bacon fried rice had a good seasoning with a spicy kick to it, but the veggies very slightly undercooked. I think the carrots might have been mixed in raw and I'm sure that was not intentional.

9163,"My dog started sneezing violently and blood started coming out of his nose. This being my first dog and near 11:00pm at night, I was scared and panicked and Googled for a 24-hr emergency pet clinic. This one was the first to pop up, so I took my dog there. The guy who looked at Fiero said he had a fox tail up his nose, and unnecessarily added that I should have used logic to realize my dog's nose was bleeding for a reason. Um, no...sometimes dogs just bleed for no reason.....I'm told its $64 for the examination, plus any other fees. The vet tells me that Fiero will need to be anesthetized, medicated, etc. Then she says that the nurse will give me a price estimate and disappears behind a sliding door. I discover that it'll cost about $500-600 just to pull the fox tail (sharp, dry weed that embeds easily into flesh) out of his nose! Not just that, the male nurse who advised me to ""use my logic"" realizes a couple items are missing, pulls the estimate paper from me and returns with a revised estimate for an extra $100! Three hours later, Fiero was better, drugged up but no longer sneezing blood. I'm relieved, but disappointed at the clinic. It was clear that they weren't going to help me unless I paid the full amount of $620. And now, looking at the bill, there are a lot of questionable items, like $137 for hazardous disposal?? The service is mediocre, the attitude was unnecessary, and the price is f*cking ridiculous. I'm looking elsewhere for emergency services.",3DLg6FHxYaueFO-47can0w
9164,"Heart attack alley.  I have heard about the Original Pantry for a long time now and decided to finally check it out. We went at 2:00am on a Sunday night and the place was still packed.  Once seated, we learned that the menu was written on various chalkboards throughout the restaurant.  As appetizers, they give out a moutain of coleslaw with a mayonaise mixure that drips off the side of the plate, and a huge plate of buttered sourdough toast, with additional slices of butter on the side.  I ordered the Pantry burger and my friend ordered the philly cheesesteak.  Both tasted good and the portions were generous, but everything was dripping in oil, butter or mayonaise.  I'm sure they have their own medic and defibrillator in the back just in case someone busts out with a heart attack mid-meal.  I came here once just to check the hype, pretty sure I'm never coming back.",3DLg6FHxYaueFO-47can0w

The food here sucked.  Their pineapple fried rice is served on an actual pineapple that has cut in half and hollowed out. While it looks impressive, its actually tasteless.  The ""small"" shaved ice is ridiculously large, they bring it out in a salad bowl.

No acknowledgement from them either. I look at the menu for a minute, they just keep talking to each other. I could not believe it. I got up and walked out.

9261,"The reason why I'm writing this review is because after I got home I started reading all the reviews in detail and realized that the same negative reviews I read from 2 months ago I experienced yesterday.  I want to start by saying that I gave my feedback to management at the restaurant and it was taken with a, hurry up and leave approach.  I let the manager (not sure if she's the owner) know that after my experience I probably would not be coming back and although she tried to fix the problem by comping a few items, she did not invite us back.  First the ambiance, amazing, restaurant looks like a million bucks and refreshing addition to our West Seattle line up.  It really stops there.  Our waitress came up to greet us and had someone behind her standing there awkwardly and no one told us if she was the assistant or shadowing it was very weird.  We ordered a dozen oysters to start, and realized that each condiment was an extra $2.  (MP for Oysters was $30-$36 for the dozen, I don't remember exactly)  None-the-less I think charging $2 for Tabasco is pretty silly (even if it is homemade).  My brother and I decided to share the Tomahawk (one we were very hungry and two the $115 price tag intrigued us to see how delish it must be).  My wife ordered the Filet.  Tomahawk was asked to be medium rare and Filet Medium.  The Filet came on the rare to medium rare side.  We were so hungry that we started at the Tomahawk and didn't even look.  (side note ALL their steaks come pre-cut, I'm use to big steaks like Tomahawks, but not Filets).  Once we were able to get her attention (I should also mention that there was probably 4 tables with guests and 8 restaurant staff sitting around the bar) she took the steak back and cooked it to well, rather than medium.  We then told her it looks like the Tomahawk and Filet's were mixed up because ours was more medium, just as feedback since we already devoured most of it.  The manager came by and offered her apologies, we then told her that we thought the steaks were cooked incorrectly but it's hard to argue because we ate it.  She offered us another 32 oz Tomahawk, which was a nice gesture, but we couldn't bring ourselves to eat more steak.  She offered us a round of drinks instead and desert.  The desert we had was the shortcake and the pudding.  The pudding tasted like it was scooped out of a jell-o pudding snack cup and the shortcake had no taste.  As we were talking amongst ourselves we all decided that for the price we are paying the food was sub-par.  The steak we ordered was supposed to be 48 day dry-aged, but had a demi-glaze bottom and had zero taste.  My wifes filet was really not edible at this point so we just chalked it up as a bad experience.  My plan was to write an email to the manager when we got home to say how we felt and explain that West Seattle is a residential neighborhood, and food is highly regarded especially if you're going to charge so much.  I wanted them to succeed so I was hoping they would take the feedback.  Then the bill came, and our Tomahawk was priced $125.  I just couldn't handle it so I walked up to her and quietly explained my frustration with the quality of the food and the price (price change) which I thought was ridiculous.  I explained to her that her prices are very expensive and with this type of pricing you expect amazing taste.  She looked like she was sort of concerned, but the smile and laugh of the person behind the oyster bar showed me that they did not care at all.  You can't open a ""fancy"" restaurant and not give good service, half the reason why people pay what they pay is for the ""expert"" service.    They took the Filet off the bill.  My frustration really came when I started reading the reviews, most of what I wrote above has been given to this restaurant from when they opened and still no adjustments have been made.  It looks like the Tomahawk is going up to $125, and from the sounds of other reviews that say prices changed from opening and the over staffing of the restaurant I don't think they've thought out their business model.  Almost $300 down the drain (and we had all those items comped) and still went home hungry. The only reason I am not giving a 1 star is because I think the manager meant well and she did comp the food no one ate, but as I see her inviting everyone back for a second chance, she did not do that to us when I specifically told her we would not be returning. I have to add the Robuchon potatoes were very good.  Gnocchi was good not great but for $16 not a big deal.  It's a shame because the place has a lot of potential.",RfzyuSAjW-8gr7DWX-AUAQ

I would say that the only thing I enjoyed about this place is that you can add your own toppings when you order the classic pancakes. They have a whole table filled with fruits, berries, whipped cream, butter, coconut flakes, almonds, and walnuts. We were both pretty hungry but not hungry enough to order too much so we shared classic pancakes and the crab grilled cheese. The pancakes were so soft that they were too soft and crumbling. The crab grilled cheese wasn't that good either. I think the bread was way too thick, the pesto I believe was overpowering, and the tomato wasn't needed. Our sides of potatoes were also really hard and seemed undercooked. I really wish I liked this place because it's so cute and everything sounded so good but wasn't :/",9miULvPHAQHM_7j5RJ5dMg

We came in and was told there would be a 20 minute wait for 4 people and that was fine. The place looked packed but everyone else was getting seated quickly. Our host was really kind and we were seated within 15 minutes. We decided that we wanted mimosas but our IDs were denied because they were still vertical (totally understandable) but when my boyfriend asked why because it has never happened to us the waitress started to catch an attitude lol. It wasn't like he was trying to be annoyed or rude and convince her to give us our drinks, he asked a question because he was honestly curious. I decided to go with a French vanilla cappuccino and before my boyfriend could start to say what he wanted to drink she started to walk away? lmao It took a while for her to come back and take our order but whatever I guess. She seemed really annoyed of us the rest of the time. I understand it's a little busy but you don't have to have an attitude. The food was okay. I ordered the German pancake and was disappointed because it was really bland. The crabs Benedict was also bland and a little cold. There really isn't much to say about it.

I asked for my drink to be put in a larger cup so they could add whip, didn't even do it lol. Everything that came out of her mouth, came off as if she didn't even want to help me.

It takes a very long time so receive service, a long time for the food to come out, and it isn't really worth the wait or for the price! Even when I was checking it, it took forever.

I don't know if it's because we're a younger crowd or if he just wasn't feeling it with us, but he was very different with the tables around us.There was also a dish that came much, much later than everything else. It was so much later that I stopped someone to ask if they'd forgotten it. The server then comes over and tells us that our was ""staggered"" so that's why the wait was so long.

9414,"Her name was Katie and unfortunately she was our server. I understand people have bad days but if a job title is a Restaurant Server certain criteria and duties should be met. If those standards cannot be met, then it's best for another employee to take over a table rather than punish the customers. Staying at work with a negative attitude is toxic to other employees and reflects poorly on the company. I chose this restaurant because of my previous positive experience and my guest from Hawaii wanted to try local food. I'm sure Katie has had better days but my guests and I had the displeasure of being at her table. She didn't bring items that were requested and we were ignored for most of the duration of our time there. We interacted with the runners more than Katie which was understandably unfair to the crew. The food turned out great though. It was difficult to accept the mandatory 20% service charge on top of the bill but then I had to think of the runners and kitchen staff who deserved it.

No. Am I still willing to come back and pay an Amazonia price just so I can post an image to social media? Not anymore after this dysfunctional visit. Huge (YUUUGE!) upset for an established company. Go at your own risk. Maybe you'll have a more positive experience.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9463,I feel Other Coast Café doesn't have quite the appeal that HoneyHole has.  Nobody was in line when I walked up and this was during lunch time. I felt concerned as I approached the counter.  I placed my order: a sandwich and a side of potato salad.  My sandwich order came up but the potato salad didn't. I asked the employee for the rest of my order. She attempted to give me something different. Apparently her coworker screwed up.  She got huffy.  I left knowing I wouldn't be back.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9464,"My friend despises this restaurant. He said it was because of the workers' attitude. I wanted to try it out to see if it was true. The woman at the register was rude and acted like she was better than me or something. I greeted her even though it should have been the other way around. The customers were odd too. One guy asked me if I was in line when I obviously had a receipt ticket in my hand. His friend looked at him confused because he asked a stupid question. I moved away from the weirdo and I think his friend knew why. It seems financial district employees have more of a time crunch for lunch so they seem to be more on edge.  A delusional girl with a giant purse was blocking the doorway and wouldn't let people out. This place, and possibly the location and layout emitted bad vibes. Although they make a decent sandwich I don't think I will return. There are lots of other good sandwich spots particularly in Pioneer Square where the employees are nice and the patrons are actually happy to get out of the office.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9468,I stared at my receipt for the longest time.  I couldn't believe I ordered so much yet gained so little.  I could have gotten more from Olive Garden or even Burger King!  I surely ate everything on my plate but I did it because I didn't want to waste it. I did it out of guilt! I took pictures but it's not worth posting since I didn't get much from it.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q

9498,Instead of a corned beef slab I got fat chunks.  Prior to visiting this restaurant my fam member and I made plans to come here for breakfast.  We reviewed the menu they had on their website and our goal was to try their country fried steak.  When we arrived at the restaurant the next morning we were informed they didn't have the country fried steak.  We were bummed out.  My fam member ordered the stone house platter.  I ordered the house hash.  When I received my order I saw that I didn't get corned beef at all.  I had a plate with chunks of fat.  All I ate from the order were the potatoes and eggs.  My fam member didn't enjoy her meal either.  The only good thing that came from our experience was the bakery next door.  The cinnamon roll was pretty good.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9504,Salty food.  I ordered the deviled eggs and the Halibut Fishwich with clam chowder.  The chowder was watery.  I had left over eggs and half of the sandwich so decided to share it with my colleague when I got back to the office.  He said that if he had high blood pressure he wouldn't have been able to eat it.  It had a great atmosphere though and I was lucky to have a window table.  I probably won't be back though.  I'm glad I tried it but I'd rather go to Ivar's or Anthony's for my seafood needs.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q

9535,"Disappointing and a complete waste of my time.  With high hopes for new restaurants in Pioneer Square this restaurant emits failure based on my experience today. After Tat's left, Calozzi's took over the location.  Calozzi's moved to the financial district and a Mediterranean restaurant moved in.  They didn't last very long.  Now this restaurant opened.  Here's what happened...I walk in.  A middle aged woman with a pony tail had a receipt in her hand.  I asked her if I had the choice to take a seat at any table.  She said yes.  I sat down at a table next to a man at another table.  He seemed to be waiting there patiently.  I asked him how long he had been waiting there.  He said a while.  A younger server visited the man to check up on him.  She leaves him and she walks right past me.  No eye contact, no menu, and no water. Another man walks in and sat down at a table.  He also gets ignored.  The middle aged woman with the pony tail wipes down a table between me and the guy who just walked in.  Why?  It was already clean!  Still no service for me or the guy that just walked in. Five minutes later the middle aged woman brings the man a glass of water.  I still have no water or menu.  She looks at me with direct eye contact and she says nothing.  How about, ""I'll be right with you"" or ""Would you like a menu?""  Nothing.  Now I'm furious.  I grab my purse, scarf, and gloves and get ready to leave. I got up, smiled at the man who was patiently waiting right when I walked in, and shouted, ""Good Luck!"" to him and I walked right out. Chefs are trying to revitalize the food scene in this part of town.  With Weyerhaeuser moving into the neighborhood restaurants have to ramp up for business.  If this business wants to survive they need to work on their customer service skills and personality.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q

I've brought colleagues, friends, and family to this restaurant many times.  After tonight's encounter with Von's hostess, I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone.  It's unfortunate that I have to miss out on their good food (Thank you, Chef) but if I'm not able to receive good service up front, then this restaurant is not worth returning to.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9542,"To put it simply, imagine you're in line at Subway.  Replace the veggies and meat with expensive pizza, add a communal table in the seating area, and fill the restaurant with hipsters.  You will like this place if you appreciate pizza artistry.  I waited 15 minutes in line.  The employees were friendly.  I tried 4 different pizzas.  In a way it was like the 4 seasons of the year based on the ingredients, weight, and colors:  1) Carmelized Onion & Pancetta (Spring)2) Stilton, Mozzarella, Tallegio, & Pecorino (Summer)3) Pecorino, Bechemel, Delicata, Butternut, Mama Lil's, Sage + Walnuts, & Chevre (Fall)4) Yukon Gold Potatoes, Mozzarella, & Tallegio (Winter)I appreciate the creativity, but when I think of pizza I think of round tomato based pies.  I think that's why I'm such a fan of Italian Family Pizza.  I'm glad I gave Pizzeria Gabbiano a try but my love for pizza belongs to another.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9550,My friend and I were on our way to Mt St Helens.  I didn't want to eat at a restaurant with a bunch of pick-up trucks or motorcycles in the parking lot so we chose this place.  I guess residents in Castle Rock don't like spice or flavor because I ordered a taco salad and it lacked just that.  I ended up bumming off my friend's order which wasn't much different.  A customer behind us was praising how good the food was.  I'm not sure if he's ever been to a major city.  We should have eaten in Centralia/Chehalis.  One good thing about this restaurant was the host/server was very friendly.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9559,"$5.50 for donuts and a rotten attitude.A colleague invited me out to lunch and because it was sunny we went to Pike Place market.  The manager of our agency recommended a donut shop and we visited the place.  Nobody was in line.  I wanted to treat the colleagues back at the office with some donuts.  I remembered from a previous visit that when I ordered an assortment of donuts they all went in one bag.  I know some of my co-workers don't like ""cross-contamination"" so I requested the assortment of donuts be placed in separate bags.  That's when I got an attitude from the employee.  She reiterated my request annoyingly then she grabbed her utensil angrily.  I looked at my colleague and she whispered to me, ""I would have walked away.""  I turned back at the employee and watched her dumped an unnecessary amount of sugar in one of the bags.  At the end of the transaction there was no ""Thank You"".  She just took my money and was done with me.I was very surprised by her unprofessionalism.  Pike Place Market is a tourist destination.  Most shop owners are happy to see their customers and help them in any way.  Their business depends on it.  Obviously this donut shop isn't hurting based on today's experience.  We went back to work and spread the word about our experience.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9560,"When you're reading all the reviews who gave this place 1-2 stars believe them because it's all true.  I used to work in the Pioneer Square area and this restaurant was a convenient location to my building.  I had lunch here one day with a friend.  We sat in the bar area.  I ordered the Taco Salad ($12.95). Not only was the service slow, the food was terrible.  The seasoning was awful.  The chicken was dry and had the texture of jerky.  Total rip off.  I went back to work and told all my co-workers my experience.  To my surprise, several others had the same experience as myself and proclaimed they boycotted the restaurant.  I went back a couple months later just to see if anything had changed.  It hadn't.  The service was just as bad.  There was a table with customers who brought their children and newborns to the restaurant.  To me, when I see ""Sports"" in a restaurant name, it's the norm to be loud, excited, and rowdy to an extent.  Apparently my group of friends offended the group with the babies and children to the point the manager told us to respect others around us, meaning we have to respect the mothers who brought their children and babies.  My friends and I left our table a little bit before half time to check out King Street Bar & Oven.  We came back to our other group of friends who stayed at their table at the Lodge after half time.  I don't know if it was out of embarrassment on their behalf, but the customers with their babies and children left during half time.  I didn't feel bad.  They should have taken the kids to Chuck-E-Cheese or Red Robin in the first place.  With that in mind, don't get excited when your team scores a goal, touchdown, or basket or else you might upset the manager or customer who brought their children.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q

9666,"If you want an 8oz cup of snobbery and a sandwich full of bad customer service then let this be your lunch spot.  I used to think they were top quality.  I don't think so anymore.  Two reasons: 1)  Inventory.  They are taking shortcuts and not ordering supplies when the are low.  When they run out of to-go boxes they double the wax paper for wrapping food.  When they're out of gelato mini bowls they use coffee cups.  2) Stock.  The gelato selection isn't keeping up with customer demand.  Gelatiamo is only a 5 minute drive away.I don't know which one is worse...this place or Zeitgeist.  Either way, I'm not coming back.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9667,Bumpy's was packed and so was Twisted Kilt.  Trackside Pizza was open and it didn't look busy.  The building rumbled and shook whenever a train passed by which is why the name is so fitting.  My friend and I ordered the Italian breaded wings.  It was overcooked.  Crunchy hard with a burnt flavor.  Service was sketchy.  My friend asked me for my glass of water because we didn't see a server pass through for a while to refill our glasses.  The bigger family tables are the money makers so I'm sure that's where the server's attention went.  It is a family oriented restaurant so I can understand.  The pizza was good but pretty expensive.  I might do take out the next time I think of this place but then again I might not.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9672,"Nora A., I will back you up on your 1 star review. I came here recently and I was not happy. The Pioneer Square employees take their time preparing coffee, they don't greet you, they don't smile, and they don't thank you. I think the employees hate their job. Quite the opposite from the Seward Park Caffe Vita. Even the pizza guy was sketchy. Sure, he'll take his time making my pizza but when the suit and tie crew walk in it's all rush, rush, rush. The pizza guy didn't even cut my pizza pieces evenly. I retract my 5 star review and the pictures I took.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q

A single file line was formed in front of the cash register but the blond girl with glasses decided to help a customer outside of the line. The customer didn't care there were other people waiting. The lady in front of me looked back and gave me a confused look. I acknowledged her confusion. When it was finally my turn a different person came up to the register and asked if I had been helped yet. I was surprised by the question and told her, ""No."" I ordered the Southwest Chicken Panini. It was carelessly slapped together: half had meat and the other half had veggies.

9697,"I feel bad for the tourists who eat here. If only they knew of the better sandwich shops downtown. I thought the outdoor splash of colors of the sandwich shop represented happiness and deliciousness of the food. A busker was playing his guitar about 20 feet from where I wanted to sit down and eat lunch. It seemed like a perfect lunch hour. I ordered the Santa Barbara sandwich (Smoked turkey, provolone, sprouts, avocado, Roma tomato) which came with a salad. I chose the Greek salad. After 5 minutes of sitting down listening to the busker sing and play his guitar he switched to a depressing mood and tone. Nobody gave him money the whole time I was there. I got my food and took a bite of the salad. It was doused with dressing. I didn't eat much of it. I took a bite of my sandwich. It tasted so bad. Processed meat. Bread tasted stale. It was pretty bad. Unfortunately that experience didn't turn out so perfect after all.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9700,"It's my Dim Sum King nightmare all over again.  Nina N.'s comment about the women who work there and how the service is, is downright correct.  I walked in and there was a customer already in line talking to the woman behind the counter.  They were pretty involved with their conversation and the woman behind the counter didn't acknowledge me.  A different customer from the dining area interrupted their conversation because she needed to get cashed out.  After getting cashed out she went back to her table and the woman in front of me and woman behind the counter continued on with their conversation.  The customer in front of me didn't care that I was ready to order.  I should have left but I figured with the new remodel the food would be better.  I eventually I got to order the shrimp dumplings.  It came out to $2.20.  I gave her a $5.  She asked if I had 20 cents.  I said, ""Sorry, no I don't.""  She gave me a dirty look.  What the heck!?!  First she ignores me when I walk in then she insults my method of payment.  I should have given the food back to her and told her to keep the change so she could buy herself a lesson in customer service.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9703,"My report: Rude and Chaotic. The head prep gal skipped taking my condiment order and decided to help the man behind me. The guy didn't care that I was next in line. Secretly I think he wanted to jump up and down & clap his hands because he was getting fed. Another employee looked at me but she didn't budge. Maybe it was fear of upsetting the head prep gal. After a while of staring back at her she finally asked what I had ordered on their electronic tablet minutes ago. The roast beef sandwich was just ""okay."" Downtown Seattle has better sandwich shops. To name a few: Delicatus, Tat's, Calozzi's, and yes, Jimmy John's. I'll just stick to the businesses who employ attentive and friendly people and surpass the ""okay"" sandwich rating.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q

I walked around the store and checked out the chocolate selection. I was not offered any help or suggestions. I walked up to the counter and ordered a hot chocolate. After receiving the hot chocolate I was told the lids were off to the side of the counter. I walked over to the side, grabbed a lid, and an employee comes though the tiny isle making me move for them. Sure they have an abundant selection of chocolate but if you're looking for excellent customer service I do not recommend coming here.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9707,"For Financial District standards I still think Café Pho is better. I chose this place because of the new feature on Seattle Yelp's home page. I walked into the restaurant and read the menu on the wall. I got my usual chicken pho. I picked a spot near the window facing Marion. I went to get my eating utensils behind the counter. I felt as if I was invading their working territory. It seemed like an odd spot to place them. I got my food pretty quickly. The noodles were cooked well. The bean sprouts and lime were fresh. They put a lot of onions and cilantro. I didn't drink much of the broth. It seemed more salty than most pho places. Some of the chicken pieces tasted funny. I didn't eat all of the pieces. Customer service was bad. I was done eating my food. I got up and as I was walking to the door I said ""Thank You"" to an employee. The employee didn't even look up. He just ignored me. It's a possibility that he had a hearing disability or he didn't understand English but management might want to consider encouraging their employees to take customer service training. Even the gal at the order counter gave off the vibe like she didn't want to be there.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9711,They need to clean their algae infested fish tank. I should have known something was a little off at this restaurant right when I saw that tank. I placed an order to go. I ordered the chicken pho and egg roll appetizers. I sat down next to the fish tank. I wanted to see the fish but I couldn't find any because of the dark green algae covering the whole tank. When I got home I noticed the bean sprouts for my pho had mold on the ends and the pho was really oily. The egg rolls weren't cooked all the way because when I took that first bite I tasted the uncooked soggy wrapper. I'm not coming back.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9714,"I wanted to come here because of ""The Girl from Ipanema"" song. The 60's catchy tune by Stan Getz & Astrud Gilberto gives off that warm and feel good vibe. Unfortunately the service was far from that and the price/quantity/quality ratio was uneven. Although my coworkers and I came in for happy hour we still had to be escorted to a table. We were seated near a window and I sat in the booth. It was lopsided and I was leaning towards my co-worker. The service was slow. The gal at the bar was doing too much at one time and partly I blame it on the economy. I did notice that the table across from us was getting more attention though. They were probably tourists or visitors of downtown because they were all dressed up. Their water was always filled (our glasses were empty) and they were constantly getting service because they ordered a lot of meat. We saw our server no more than 3 times willingly. The happy hour menu at the table was deceiving. They did not updated it and instead of happy hour ending at 7:30 it's now 6:00. The online menu is also different. I had the coxinha de galinha, also known as a chicken drumstick. They only give you 2 and it was $4. Rip off. I tasted my coworker's Manioc Fritas. It's like a French fry. I wanted ketchup because it was so bland. But of course it's an insult to ask for ketchup in a Brazilian restaurant.  On my way to the bathroom I saw the unlimited salad bar. Not a very good selection. You're better off getting satisfied at a casino, Zoopa, or Sizzlers.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9716,"I asked myself 2 questions after eating here. 1) Did I order the wrong thing? I couldn't decide between the chicken chops or the fried rice with Taiwanese sausage. My server recommended the fried rice. It came out on a large platter, family style. The plate was chipped. It tasted burnt. I ate less than 85% of the dish. I guess I should have asked her what the most popular item on the menu was. 2) Will I ever eat here again? Probably not. A couple of bums walked in and made the whole dining experience very uncomfortable. They were loud and obnoxious. After they ordered one of them walked outside and beat his coat against the Chinatown gate. The other guy went to the bathroom to do who-knows-what. The fact that there's a bum bar at the corner of 5th & King doesn't help.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9722,"Chaos in the ""Kitchen"" and it was painful to watch. A co-worker and I came here for the 12 o' clock lunch hour. We walked in and were seated right away. We were served tea and for about 10 minutes we browsed the menu and waited for someone to take our order. The 2 people next to us walked in after us but they got to order first because one of them spoke the language. I guess they had an advantage with that one. I decided to wave one of the servers down to get her attention. I ordered the #15 oven bake. My co-worker ordered a noodle dish. While we waited again we saw one of the workers fall on the floor. She was wearing flip flops...probably not the best footwear when running around. More customers started coming in. A couple of guys sat next to us but they didn't get their menus. They probably sat there for more than 5 minutes and one of them finally spoke up and got the server's attention. My co-worker got her noodle dish. I didn't get mine yet. She said that it needed hot sauce. She tried to wave a server down but it was so busy/chaotic that the server didn't stop to hear her request. Eventually a server came back to the area and she got to ask for hot sauce. About 5 minutes later I got my oven bake. It was okay. It was my first time trying something like that so I can't complain. Even paying for our food was difficult. I saw many order tickets scattered across the counter. We stood there for probably 2 minutes and finally someone helped us. I think if I were to come back I would just order my food to go.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q

Most of the tables and chairs were empty. That should have been my first hint. I got in line and waited for a man to finish up his transaction at the register. A different customer grabbed a sandwich and got in line behind me. Instead of helping me first, a different gal behind the counter asked the man behind me if he wanted his sandwich heated up. The man was confused because he looked at me. Yes, why didn't the girl try to take my order first? I looked at the man and I gave him the ""It's okay, go ahead"" look. After the gal heated up his sandwich she asked me what I wanted to order. I ordered the chicken noodle soup with French bread. The French bread was hard as a rock. I only took one bite to realize that it could chip a tooth. I threw it away. The chicken noodle soup was salty and no chicken. It wasn't worth $5.26. It wasn't worth the experience.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q

After I purchased my Chicken Banh Mi I waited at the 12th & Jackson bus stop. While I waited a lady next to me pointed to my sandwich and asked where I got it from. I said, ""I just got it one block north of here called Seattle Deli."" She asked me if it was any good. I told her, ""I don't know. It'll be my first time trying it."" I then smiled and said, ""Once I try it I'll let you know."" I unwrapped the paper packaging from the sandwich and took a bite. I captured a mouthful of bread. I unhappily chewed it. My second bite was more interesting. The mayo dressing didn't have enough ""zing"". I could have easily slapped on some Best Foods mayo and it would have tasted the same. The chicken was thinly sliced and flavorless. I finished chewing and I told the lady that I liked Saigon Deli [1237 S Jackson St] better.

9731,"I always thought the famous sign ""We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone"" was just for people that wanted to eat at a nice restaurant but couldn't because they were wearing flip flops or had a wife-beater shirt on. I had neither and this restaurant surely exercised that right. My friend and I were visiting Wenatchee and my friend's sister wanted to check this place out. I was excited because the exterior of the restaurant looked really new and welcoming. We walked in and we stood at the sign which requested us to wait for a host. A couple minutes rolled around and someone finally came. He asked how many people needed to be seated. It was only us 3. He told us that he would be right back. I assumed he walked off to find a clean open table. He walks over to a booth. He stands there with his back towards us, cleaning it I'm guessing. A couple of minutes pass by. Then he walks over to different table of customers and starts taking their order. I looked at my friend and his sister. I told them, ""This doesn't feel right."" We should have been seated right after he was done at the booth. Customers were looking at us. They were probably wondering why we hadn't been seated yet. The customers knew something was off. We were tired of waiting so we started to walk out. A waitress noticed us leaving and she told us that we would get a table once she cleaned one off. Half the restaurant was empty and there were plenty of open tables. We declined and continued to walk out. If it wasn't for their poor customer service we never would have gone to McGlinns. And guess what? McGlinns was packed, we were greeted right away, and were seated within 30 seconds.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9742,"A Terrible Beauty is negative and unwelcoming. Cold and angry faces circulate the room. The employees are very particular and selective when it comes to customer service. It's a possibility you won't even get to try their food. Maybe that's for the best. I came in for breakfast with a fam member. We found a table and started watching the football game. Our server took our order. He brought us our drinks. About 15 minutes later a family sat down at a table next to us. The server took their order. Every so often our server came to look at our tables but never asked, ""Is everything okay?"" 30 minutes later the family next to us received their food order. We did not. As concerned customers we walked up to the bar to find out what had happened. Our server placed our food ticket order onto someone else's order. As soon as he took it off their ticket order it was completely cancelled. It would make sense to figure out why someone's order ticket was added incorrectly but it didn't seem like a priority to him. He did not show sympathy or concern. I did not appreciate how the service was handled. Most restaurants and bars make sure their customers are doing okay and satisfied. This restaurant failed to do so. Management needs to learn from the Irish pubs in Seattle like Fado, The Blarney Stone, and Owl & Thistle. The employees welcome their guests and they accept them as who they are. They will crack jokes and smile. They emit a positive vibe. Customers return because of their great personalities and food. I will NOT return to this sad excuse of a restaurant.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q

By 1:40pm everyone got their food except me. I got up from the table, went to the employee at the register and asked when my order would be ready. She pointed back to the kitchen and said they were making it. That was a lie. They didn't even start making my fresh rolls, an appetizer. I requested my food to be boxed up. By 1:45pm I was ready to walk out the door. Soon enough they brought out my noodle dish then the fresh roll. Angrily I paid cash. I had to leave my co-workers behind and they knew I was disappointed. The employee kept apologizing to save face. She kept smiling at me and wished me a happy new year so that my co-workers could watch. Her pleading was fake. I saw right through it. It was all an act so that my co-workers could watch and feel sorry for her. When I got back to work I explained to my other co-workers what had happened.

I'm not fond of listening to the clamoring of pots and pans so I politely asked him to seat us away from that area. He brought us to the farthest southwest corner of the building underneath a TV. It's a good thing the TV's volume wasn't turned up or else I would have had a fit. On the way to our new table we saw tables that were not cleaned off yet. I guess they were understaffed. The first dim sum cart came. I requested for shrimp balls. They had none. The 2nd cart came. I requested the shrimp with chives. The lady placed it on the table. I took one bite. It was cold. Other carts came around. No Chinese broccoli. No bean curd. No honey walnut prawns.

After our confused silence and blank stares he then realized what he said, he apologized, and with an embarrassed look on his face he continued to ask us what we wanted to eat. He was a good sport.

A long table was in the middle of the room with 2 long booths on each side against the walls. The gal had to teach us how to use the karaoke machine with remotes. The karaoke song selections were in Chinese and English. I'm sure there were songs we could have sung but we weren't sure what the Chinese characters meant. My cousin also asked the gal about the food menu. The food was good considering the fact that I was still sketchy about the whole experience. We sang some songs. We ate some Thai/Chinese food.

My request could not be accommodated. I had the soup and salad combo. The soup was chicken congee. It tasted like they dowsed it with sugar. The chicken bits were minimal. The salad was Caesar. The dressing was not creamy and the cheese topping didn't taste right. The texture was like salty granules. I had to throw the rest away in the garbage because it tasted so bad. I won't be coming back here for Vietnamese food.  I'll stay in Chinatown/ID.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9801,"If Fry's customer service had a smell, it would smell like this: the bum on the bus, funky cheese, sweaty socks, raw sewage, sour milk...oh yeah, I can go on but I think you get it. The smell would make you run out the store and never come back. All I wanted was a flash drive. I finally found a representative. I asked and he just pointed. If you dare enter this store, analyze the employees. How long will it take until they notice you? How knowledgeable are they with product details?  Would you feel good about making a purchase based on their comments? Do they take their job seriously?",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9803,"I've visited better restaurants in Portland to know what it's like to feel welcome. This Seattleite will not return to this place. My friends were still sleeping and I wanted to get out of my hotel room. I wandered the streets of downtown Portland. No traffic. Sunny morning. I didn't feel like eating at a coffee shop so I walked into this restaurant. I was brought to the far back corner near the wait-staff's register. It was unsettling. I noticed plenty of customers were seated near the front of the restaurant with plenty of open seating beyond them. I sat near nobody. It felt wrong and awkward. I should have asked why I was brought to that part of the restaurant but I kept quiet. I sat down. I ordered my food. I read the local paper (Portland's equivalent to Seattle Weekly). I barely saw my server. I left disappointed. Local or not, customers should be treated the same.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9811,"We sat close to the cooking area and it was hot and loud. I really smelled like food after we left. I was really surprised how expensive the menu was. What lured me in was the 24-hour service. I guess it's good for late night dining when you're all dressed up after a party or clubbing. However, if you just want to eat at a diner that's 24 hours and you don't care how you look, then you're better off at at 24-hour Denny's or IHOP.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9817,I don't know why people come to this place for food. It's nothing to brag about. The only thing I liked about this cafe was the colorful decor but I can get that same satisfaction going to Azteca. Their name should be changed to represent the better of the two: The paddle club.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9822,I came here for happy hour and it was over priced.  We didn't get a lot for our money. Sure the atmosphere was nice but I'm all about food and service. We barely saw our server and the food was mediocre.  For more food for your money go to Genki Sushi.  For service go to Blue C Sushi.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9827,I know this place was an inspiration for scenes in Frasier but the food is just bad. I think the people that really enjoy this restaurant are vegetarians because the food is so bland. When they took away the Reuben sandwich it was over. So the bookstore is gone. I wonder how long it will take until they close the cafe.  A notch up from this place is Central Bakery. If you don't like Central Bakery then go to Specialty's near Uwajimaya.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9829,"This restaurant leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth.  Have you ever been to a restaurant where the hosts wants you to move to a different table so they could cater another customer?  That's exactly what happened to me at Green Leaf.  I wanted to try this place out for lunch.  The atmosphere was crammed-the feeling of claustrophobia.  I was brought upstairs. I was seated at a 4 person table. I sat down. Got comfortable. Soaked in the atmosphere. 5 minutes later the host wanted me to move to a smaller table.I thought: What if I said no?  Would they poison my food?  Would I not get better service?I should have walked out of that restaurant but I didn't. I wanted to try the food...and I did. I was let down.  The food was bland and I didn't even finish it.  I didn't even want to box it up.  Guess what? Even though I moved to a different table, the service was still horrible.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9835,I came here because it was close to work. I ordered the chicken gyro. I didn't like the presentation of the chicken. It didn't look right.  It was flat like a really thin pancake. It was like processed deli meat. I was expecting chicken chunks.  It didn't taste right either. It tasted like something a vegetarian might eat. The texture was rubbery.  I won't be back. I'll go to Mr. D's or Zaina's for gyros.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9837,"The building has a scary garage and elevator. It would be that last place I would want to be in if there was an earthquake.  Even though the parking is free, the spots are for compact cars.  Whatever you do, park on the street and take the stairs from the outside. The food isn't remarkable. I still think Jade Garden is the best. The original restaurant was down on Rainier but then it burned down.  Then they came back earlier this year but kept the restaurant on Jackson.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9840,When I walked into this place I thought of the Titanic scene where the guys are smoking cigars and drinking brandy.  I felt like I was too young for this restaurant. The food wasn't spactacular. The Met is better. If I want something cheaper I'll go to McCormick & Schmick's.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9846,"The people that generally come here are customers that go to the Seahawks, Sounders, or Mariners games. It's one of the closest restaurants to the stadiums. Definitely not the best.

If my co-workers invite me to this place again, I will have to decline.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9849,"Do you like being ignored? Do you want minimal food selection? If so, this place is just for you! I came here with some buddies after work. The decor is like The Daily Grill.  We barely saw our waitress and it took forever to get the check.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9851,This restaurant has the worst service.  I came here during lunch expecting something amazing. To my surprise the restaurant was empty. I checked out the menu right when you walk in and it noticed a lot of their entrees were pretty expensive. I walked up to place my order and the guy was not friendly at all. After I got my food and took my first bite I was not impressed.  Sure the exterior of the restaurant looks nice but that's about it.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9856,I came here for Cinco de Mayo.  I wanted a chicken dish but they ran out of chicken.  I had a beef dish instead.  The place was packed. Luckily my co-worker and I got a table after a couple of techies left.  I had Jarritos for the first time.  Pretty good stuff.  It was fun trying this place out but I'd rather eat at Bruno's.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9860,I've been here a couple of times only because the other restaurants on Alki were packed.  They don't have the best food but their service was attentive and friendly.  I remember my friend and I sat at a booth near the window and the seats were ripped.  Pretty ghetto.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9862,I never had a reason to visit Mill Creek until some friends moved up there.  We arrived late afternoon. The restaurant had their windows open and the cool summer breeze flowed through.  We sat in a booth near the back. The food was pretty good. The portion size was large. The service could have been better. Customers shouldn't have to ask if their water could be filled.  She could have done a better job scanning our table for anything we needed.  Hopefully she'll learn to be more attentive.  I probably won't be back because it's so far away and because of the lack of service.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9872,"Their containers used to be huge but they're attempting to save money by investing in smaller containers. Blame it on the economy I guess. My orders were mostly to go. The people at the counter were inconsistent. One time I had a guy that was energetic and friendly. Another time there were 2 girls and one guy and they acted as if they didn't want to take my order. No ""Hi"" or ""Hello""...pretty much just a stare and a ""What do you want?"" look. I decided not to come back because there's a better Thai restaurant in Southcenter. Now I know why tables were empty. The food was okay but I expect better service. Better Food + Better Service = Bai Tong Restaurant (near Toy's R Us)",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9874,What happened to this place? I used to come here a lot when I was a kid. Almost 20 years later I came back to see if anything had changed. The interior widened. The food got worse. You know how you put Asian left overs in the fridge and the next morning the sauce is jiggly because it hardened? Well that's exactly what I got when I ordered dim sum bean curd. Jiggly bean curd.  I was so grossed out I lost my appetite. I don't know how much longer this restaurant will keep up but I'm not coming back.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9878,This restaurant and Thai Place in Uwajimaya were the only locations in the ID at the time that served Thai food.  They only serve family style so the chances of you having a to go box is pretty high.  Service is not attentive. Just flagging them down seemed like an inconvenience.  Now that Thai Curry Simple came along I haven't been back.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9883,I have stomach issues after eating here but the other people I eat with have no problems. The weird thing is I always get the boring menu items: Chicken Teriyaki and tempura. The last time I came here my friends and I got to sit in the Tatami Room. That was pretty cool sitting on the floor. I was worried at first because I get leg cramps if I have to crisscross but they have a hole in the floor so your legs can dangle over the ledge. I haven't found my favorite Japanese restaurant in the ID yet but I'm still looking.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9885,I loved Zesto's as a kid but I moved out of town.  When I visited Ballard 18 years later houses were replaced by condos and Zesto's wasn't the same.  The quality of food was bad.  The only thing that felt the same was the interior of the restaurant.  It's really sad when a restaurant you once enjoyed is now something you will not return to.,ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9887,"I wanted to try this place because of Seattle Weekly's 2010 happy hour booklet. When my co-workers and I walked in we were confused.  Usually when you walk into a restaurant you are supposed to be greeted.  Nobody greets you here.  We just wandered around trying to figure out if we needed to seat ourselves.  So we found an empty table and sat there.  Eventually a waitress noticed us.  I ordered the sliders. The first bite I took was not good.  It was really dry.  I wasn't about to waste my money so I just drowned the sliders in ketchup.  Ugh, I punished my stomach that night.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9889,"This is the only salad bar in Pioneer Square.  Payment is by the pound.  There are many choices of fix-ins and dressings.  I noticed many people came through the door and took their food to go.  They only have 4 seats and the dining area is set up like bar style tables against a wall. It's a great place for healthy people. However, I enjoy entree food like tuna pasta, baked salmon fillet, and brown rice along with my salad so I will take a 3rd Ave bus to Market Fresh in the financial district instead.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9891,"This is a place to go for dim sum if Jade Garden, Honey Court, Purple Dot, and New Hong Kong Restaurant are packed.  I've come here for lunch during the week and on the weekend.  Both times we were seated right away and the carts came right at us.  They could use a building upgrade.  The building structure feels really old and the last time I came the windows were dirty.  I don't know if some kid smeared their slobber against the window but it would have been nice if they could have wiped it down.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q

They gave a free muffin to the bachelorette.  We got our food within 10 minutes. So just as an FYI, if your food takes more than 30 minutes then something is wrong.  You can avoid this kind of error by just going to the buffet.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q

They had a sign that said to check your order before you leave. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt so I just trusted they were capable enough to follow an order ticket. Apparently they can't. They need some serious customer service training because they are definitely not famous for that.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q
9897,"I wanted to try this place because it's the oldest restaurant in Seattle.  I should have realized this place is a tourist trap.  I did not enjoy my food.My order: Caesar Salad with chicken.  It took 15 minutes to prepare.  The amount of chicken was less than a 1/4 cup.  Some of the chicken chunks were dark and nasty.  The plate was small.  $10 down the crapper.  I was still hungry.

The selection of food on the conveyor belt is mediocre. You will notice the food that rounds about on the belt are the cheaper selections. You have to ask for the exotic sushi and special items. Clientele is geared toward the younger crowd. They play 93.3 and 106.1 music.

9933,"Party of 2.  First time, last time.  It was an awkward experience.  1)  We walked in hoping to be greeted but we stood at the door looking clueless as to whether we should have seated ourselves or waited for a host.  A waitress finally noticed us after a minute and pointed us to a table.2)  I noticed 2 other tables (both parties of 2 and both seated after us) received their food before us.  I started to worry our waitress forgot our order.  After 25 minutes, I got up from the table, walked over to the counter, and asked when our order would be up.  It took a while for the waitress to find our order ticket.  She said it would be coming up next. 3)  Total wait time for our food=35 minutes.",ZWm9XygjvxHOBeL1JRhl4Q

Positives include a cavernous space to hold visiting hangry sports teams, kitschy decor, and a decent toppings bar. I'm sorry but $13+ for a combo of not even mediocre food should be a crime--for that price you can go to a real restaurant and have quality beef without a pile of raw toppings carelessly thrown on top.

It was just too dense for my liking and the frosting on top added nothing flavor-wise. Sort of sad to see this place go since the location has been a bakery for so long and it sort of harkens back to a less hipsterfied Seattle, but the interior is just tired so I'm not surprised it's closing.

At the original Hamburger Mary's the servers were catty but only in a fun camp way and the food was never amazing but it was solid dinner food. What it is now is just sad and creepy. It's like a piece of Fisherman's Wharf in the Castro which is already pretty much only older rich white gay men, the straight families that actually own all the housing and the tourist who come to stare at it all.   It's actually a big place but I wouldn't have known it as they tried to put us a the tiniest table up front even though there were plenty of 2 tops and 4 tops available. when we finally got one the bench was wet...the only queen was the one hosting and she didn't interact with us sticking to hot young gay guys and slightly drunk white blond girls but avoiding most people.Our server had an attitude from jump. He had already argued with the table next to us so we didn't want any issues but he wasn't having it. It was super loud and everyone was shouting to be heard but he told both us and the other table that we didn't tell him the right order or the right food and I BELIEVE he didn't hear but that doesn't mean folks weren't give him the right order. Our table got a variety of burgers and the wagyu burger tasted exactly like the regular burger and they both were overcooked. to get even the most basic burger it's going to be $14 and it's easy to get a $20 burger but these didn't taste like $20 burgers. He may have forgotten to put our order in because the other table next to us who came in after us got food first, we didn't really care but it was noticeable especially when he asked how things were and we didn't have food! The drinks were not the drinks would expect in the Castro at that price. Enough said.It felt like I was at corporate chain who were just using the very loose drag connection to sell bland food and bland drinks.It's sad, they started in SF but perhaps like SF they lost what made them fun.There is a wheelchair lift between the two levels.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

10178,"TL;DR Been there 3 times. NEVER EVER going back. Horrible place where basic rules like not leaving laundry in the dryers is ignored. Literally fails as both a laundrymat and a cafe.Owner claimed anyone will be arrested if they remove dry clothes from a dryer despite every non hipster laundrymat in SF having signs saying to not leave clothes unattended or they will be removed. But that was not the worst, the attendant was MIA and then clueless about anything to do with the machines. I literally did not know he worked there until I asked him point blank and even then other than saying yes, he didn't offer any help. A laundrymat attendant doesn't have to do much but this guy was doing nothing and knew nothing. An old guy who turned out to be a customer tried to help us but had no idea how the dryers worked. The repair guy was also nice (btw there has been a repair person there 2 out the 3 times I've been there). The owner was the worst! Earlier in the cafe I watched her ignore customers, then spend almost 20 minutes talking to a guy while people waited. There was an issue with setting the temperature which the attendant had no clue about and then when the owner came she was condescending and argumentative. She said we should never have to come again which I told her we totally agreed with!!! She made sure to tell me she's a very successful business owner which actually means this is the first business she has ever owned and I guess it takes a degree from FIDM to make something that brings the worst of a cafe experience and a laundrymat. Also funny that she claims to have the business opened for 3 years when it didn't open until last year!  A laundrymat doesn't need much- available washers and dryers and an attendant to make sure they are available! But I guess that's too much for hipsters! So if you want to go to a laundrymat where all the washers and dryers are filled with finished loads and not removed and the owner thinks that's a great business model! It doesn't matter how short the cycles are if they are always full and the attendants refuse to remove the finished items. The cafe is pretty horrible too, in the winter it was freezing and on the odd warm days it's boiling. The website claims it wants to elevate the laundry experience which I guess means make it longer, harder and more annoying to do all while drink over priced drinks. I will say the counter people in the cafe are really nice and I am sorry they have to work there. Also the whole cafe/laundrymat has been around forever and brainwash RIP did it far better. So if you have hours to waste while you wait for your startup to acquired or your trust fund check to come in this is a great place for you!",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10186,"Ok I found one food that isn't good in Barcelona and it's a food that really almost no one outside of Montreal and NYC (really Manhattan and Brooklyn and parts of Queens) gets right. The bagel. Bagels are boiled. Bagels are chewy with a crust on the outside. Bagels from Montreal are a little sweet but bagels are NOT bread. A real bagel does not need to be toasted to have crisp outside. A bagel can not be flattened like bread. I didn't expect a real bagel here. More a bagel shaped bread that when toasted would be ok. No, these are really bad, super sweet, the texture is like cheap American wonder bread. It's worse than frozen supermaket bagels. They are so very very bad. If you are an American who gets bagels at chain or frozen and has never had the joys of a good NYC bagel you will probably like these just like you think Taco Bell is good mexican and Donnie Trump isn't that bad. If you're an American who comes to Barcelona and thinks the food which is some of the best in the world is weird and want to eat crap come here. These are not Donald Trump bad but they are pretty bad. Unless you are jonsing for a bagel avoid.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10187,"Dissapointing, this is style over substance with a lack of creativity and at times a lack of basic cooking skills. Without a doubt one of the most dissapointing high end meals I've had in Palm Springs. Geared for weekend crowd who equate valet and high price tags with class I'm not sure what I found more offensive the patronizing servers, the very drunk very loud botoxed diners or the food that was poorly cooked. Some of the worst octopus I've had in North America.There is a certain type of restaurant that I don't care for and that is dying out. The restaurant where it's about style over substance and the staff judges the diners. They still exist but almost always the poor food quality seems intrinsically linked to condescending staff. mister parker's is that kind of place. It started when we pulled up in our campvan instead of our Porsche. We went camping in Joshua Tree but you would have thought we came from the moon by the attitude of the valet. Then we got to the restaurant where the host literally ignored us until I said excuse me three times and then he looked pissed. While the space is charming with style of a British men's club in the late 1960's, think wood and risque art, they have made no attempt to have sound baffling. We were dressed casually with me in a button up shirt and no suit jacket since there was no dress code required. The diners were a selection of very drunk gay men and their straight lady friends, a French speaking family who's kids were kids and acted as such and various couple trying to have intimate dinners which with the kids and the drunks wasn't really possible. It was hard to hear each other over the din of the drunks. The menu looks amazing especially the starters and we decided to get all the starters and a few side dishes. We knew it would be a lot of food for two people but we didn't have a budget and wanted to try things. Our server, another older man continued to have the same poor attitude as the host talking down to us about the food and assuming we were unfamiliar even with the French names which is hilarious since the spouse is French and actually pronounced the dishes correctly unlike the server. Once the order was taken we barely him again as all the dishes were brought out by staff that have the time did not say what the dish was or who said it so fast we had no idea what they were saying. I had told them to plate and serve as the kitchen wanted trusting that they would not fire all the dishes at the same time and would serve from cold to hot. That was not the case.The best things we ate were the oysters and the gnocchi. The worst was the octopus which was the worst octopus I've had in North American. It was inedible, chewy and didn't even seemed properly prepped. Octopus is probably one of the most popular proteins in US high end dining right now and I know that many chefs in the US aren't as experienced with as the chefs in Europe and I'm lucky to be in Spain every year but that plate should have never left the kitchen. We did not eat it and while the server saw that we had not eaten it, they did not ask about it and I had to bring it up. The other dishes all had decent ingredients although not of the highest quality especially the scallops which I think may have even been frozen and I felt like I was eating knock-offs of far better dishes from chefs in NYC, LA and SF and far worse than anything I've eaten in years in France. Certainly despite putting everything in French most of the dishes that were French derived were pall comparisons to the food we eat in the Côte d'Azur.We kept waiting for the meal to get better but it did not. I know the level of food at Palm Springs restuarants has often been geared to a more conservative and staid palate but the Parker Palm Springs bills itself as being geared more for a younger and more international crowd. It needs to have restaurants then that match the quality of large city and international tourist destinations and it needs to have staff that reflect that. That was not what we experienced. I would have been happy to pay the 200+ bill if the food and service had been at that level. It was not.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

10205,"This place promises the taste of Spain particularly of Catalonia but what it gives is just a hint of Spanish cuisine and it is more like the wedding food of the Can Font outside of Barcelona is know for than the dubious claim to a connection to Michelin stars on the website or Catalonian food on the menu.On the English site for Can Font the executive chef totes that he was trained under the father of a chef that has a Michelin star. This is like me claiming I am world champion level tennis player because I've played with Serena William's dad. Now on the Spanish language site of Can Font the focus is as much more on the wedding services and on the French technique of the chef. And the food would be excellent for a wedding but not for a upscale night out costing at $30 a person.I'm lucky enough to go to Spain twice a year and spend most of my time in Barcelona. I love that Spanish food especially Catalonian food is becoming popular in North America. What I don't love is over priced tapas and dishes from Valencia labeled as Catalonian. Paella is from Valencia, yes you can get it in Barcelona but that's not the best place for it by far. On the website it touts the restaurant is doing upscale Catalonian food. Neither of those things is really true. The dishes are of an average quality and not a step up from the average good paella in Spain especially in Valencia. They were out of some of the ingredients for one of our dishes. All the dishes were fine, just nothing special and at $30 plus dollars for some of them I expect more both in terms of creativity and ingredients.The diners were older and botoxed and of the set that doesn't like to expand their taste buds too far. The service was excellent with an attentive staff although they were still getting their service down and I noticed one staff person being spoken to rather loudly and curtly for making a mistake which is something you should never do in front of diners.They have spent time to make the dining space nice but the light from the florescent lights in the kitchen spilled over into the dining room and made for an unpleasant experience with the glare. Try to get a table by the windows which are farther from the kitchen. It's a place that will appeal to the folks from Happy Valley who want a night out with their friends or regional tourists but at this price point I expect better food.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10220,"If you are one of the new residents of the Mission you might love Dr. Juan Luque and his office. If you don't have insurance avoid this place. If you care about local culture and people being respectful of everyone I would avoid it. While I was there I was treated quite nice by the staff (I have insurance and am white presenting) but the office staff was rude to several non-native English speakers. Then when I dealt with the Dr. Luque he was very short in his comments, made some comments that seemed borderline sexist and rude (I guess I was suppose to agree since he thought I was a gay man?). Glad it turned out to not be serious as I thought and I was able to go to my regular wonderful dentist and not continue with this Doctor.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10226,"UPDATE: the doctor called me and claimed that he does the study out of another office and I should have known that I wasn't there for the study since it's only out of his other location and to tell me his fees are really low and why was I complaining. He also compared seeing him to go to an Apple store and of course he was going to be paid. He also said the women who told me she only took appointments and didn't know anything about the medical stuff was in fact his assistant and had full access to all medical records.Original review.Watch out if your primary care doc recommends you do his fatty liver study. You'll be charged for a consult and a test even though it states that all study related tests and visits are covered. But the worst part by far is his front desk staff who while seeming nice and polite became very mean and rude when asked any questions. My primary care doc recommended that I see him for a specific study and I made an appointment specifically mentioning the study and indeed that was exactly what we talked about during the appointment and he said I would need an ultrasound and another test to see if I should be in the study. Fine. I thought it was odd that they asked for my health insurance card but didn't think much of it till later. The first odd thing was they sent me to get an ultrasound in the hospital there and the desk person told me it would be a 100 dollar copay which was odd since I've gotten them at my primary care doctor's location and there was no copay at all and sure enough that was the case again. Then I went and had the test done right in Bonacini's office and what do you know? I get a bill for the test (after they put it through my insurance). I tried to call the office and the same front desk person told me it must be a billing issue and to contact them which I tried to do twice finally getting a hold a person who told me they were just sending the bills that the doctor's office had sent them and I had to contact them.I was so annoyed I just wanted to pay the bill and never deal with this scammer again but when I tried to to pay I realized there was no online way to pay and even worse  they told me they wouldn't take credit or debt cards unless it was in the office and couldn't do it by phone or I would have to mail a check to a random address. It's 2017, who the heck even pay by physical check and doesn't even let you pay by phone or web?????So I had to go during their business hours ie. when I have to work to pay this. I asked Angela the front desk person why I had to pay to be part of a study and first she looked all confused and then defensively said ""well that's a billing thing"" and made a big showing of calling them seeming very surprised when they actually picked because according to her their day is done at 3pm (such hard workers). Sure enough the billing folks said the same thing and she just looked me and said well you were charged for the meeting with the doctor and for the test not for a study. I said ""what were the meeting and the test for then?"" which of course there was no answer for since the only reason I went there was for the study.  And then she just got more defensive and said well I just make appointments and send the information to billing so I'm not going to anything about it. Absolutely ridiculous. Then she of course was like you still have to pay the bill but not before she looked at my medical records and told me I wasn't qualified for the study anyways (something that I was never contacted about). So either she is lying about just being the front desk person and is qualified to deal with personal medical records or she is violating HIPPA and was looking at records she couldn't have. Either way no one should have to pay to see if they qualify for a study. And if a doctor's office is going to charge you they should be up front and they might want to join us in the 21st century and do online and by phone payments.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

COME HERE.We were looking for a second car (actually a practical third car to go with a electric car and our collectible car). In the past we've had Hondas and Volkswagens for our daily drivers. There was a very specific make and model that my spouse was interested in and was ready to purchase so long as they could test drive it first. We were ready to buy as soon as we took the test drive so finding one in the area was the biggest priority. We called all the area Ford dealers (Portland and Washington) and the folks here claimed to have the car on the lot while everyone else was honest and told us there was one on order but no dealer had it allocated to them yet. This was the first of many shady things they did. We made an appointment to come for a test drive only to get there and be given the runaround.Things they did-claimed that we had wanted to see another carclaimed that the car was just out on a test driveclaimed that focus and festa drive the same so driving one would be the same as a test driveclaim that we wouldn't need a test drive to start the purchasethat was while we spent a 1/2 hourwaiting for them to try to find the carhad no knowledge of the specs of the version of the car we were interested and even said how they couldn't remember that stuff cause it was too hard. Meanwhile my spouse kept correcting them not just about that car but about Ford cars for the last decade. There were two bro guys who basically tried to tag team bully us into looking at another car. Also, we drove in with a luxury sports car and told them we wouldn't probably by the car in cash and yet they treated us like we were looking for a handout. Never offered us a drink, never brought us to an office. While we were waiting we were seated next to an older couple who were looking a higher end car and were getting the same bait and switch complete with them not being able to find the car they wanted to test drive.They never apologized for not having the car in stock claiming that they do such a high volume of business they couldn't know all the cars they actually have on the lot. Maybe I've been lucky in the last 15 years that we've never dealt with slimy tactics like these guys used but it cost them a sale. We found another place that was honest and was willing to have the car driven to us from another state. We had to wait longer but since it's a secondary car we weren't in a rush and happy to do business with honest people.The best was when the sales person called a couple of days later claiming that the car we wanted to see had been allocated to someone else but he could get another one for us if we purchased right away, we said no and sure enough the next day he called and said that the car that had been ""allocated to someone else"" was magically available again. HAHAHA.  Never going back here. Sad thing was if they had just been honest and told us it wasn't in stock but had worked to get another brought to us to test drive at a later date, they could had the sale.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

A very small portion for 17 dollar and itusually it is served with ponzu and is marinated in sake but this did not appear to be prepared that way. We got the uni nigari which it appeared a single uni had been portioned out over two pieces. The rolls we had ranged from 8 to 15 but all had a very small portion of fish in them.

After two weeks they say everything needs to be replaced so the warranty company calls in a second opinion which can't even test it because these geniuses have literally cut pipes and taken the entire system apart. So they have to wait until Accent comes back to put everything together. We are now 4 weeks since the problem started. Company 2 of course says there is no leak, it was probably low fluid and leaks out some valves which they replace.

I used to get a couple of suit dry cleaned here but it always took so long to get them back and had gotten a pair of pants hemmed a few years ago for 12 dollars.Went in to get 4 pairs of pants hemmed. I knew that the inseam was going to be shorter than normal so I made it a point to measure each one with the counter person and have her write on both reciepts the exact measurement from inseam. The earliest they said they would be really was a week. Yes a week to get 4 pairs of pants hemmed. The woman at the counter didn't seem to care and didn't want to measure each pair.AND the price was $18 each pair. Sure when I went to pick them up, first the woman tried to get payment before she gave me the pants, I told there was no way that was happening, then she just tried to hand them to me all wrapped up. That's when I knew something was off. I asked for a measuring tape and sure enough one pair was a full inch longer. Her response? She didn't care...no offer to do them the right length. Nothing.

Also they have not one but two service fees as well as 2 dollar fee for splitting a dish.The only dish that would be worth coming back for was the charred octopus served whole and room temperature.

10320,"I feel sorry for anyone who thinks this is Basque cuisine or that it is representative of the current state of modern food in Spain. Even judging it from the lens of being inspired by Spanish, Catalan or Basque it is for the most either uninspiring or unskilled in execution.TL:RL: unskilled and uneven food and service that fails to live up to it's inspiration and the current level of SF restaurants.Longer review:Food: I am not sure why they have the names in Spanish especially some really classic dishes like Gambas al Ajillo and Patatas Bravas when they were poor poor imitations or bastardizations of the dishes. The Patatas Bravas was served swimming in a tomato sauce like the kind in Burgos but never that much is served on it. Usually either it's on the side or a small amount drizzled over it.At least the Patatas Bravas (8.50) was ok but I almost sent the Gambas al Ajillo (13) back and I wish I had. This is probably one of the most well known Spanish tapas outside of Spain, a simple preparation of prawns with tails still on in a  rich garlic oil. What I got was tiny overcooked shrimp minus the tails in a bland oil that was barely warm. If I was in the kitchen I would have never let the dish go out.Other dishes worked better. The pintxo flight of four bites (12)  only two of which were actual pintxos, the pintxo gilda which had rather subpar olives and anchovies compared to what you get in San Sebastián and certainly you would never pay 2 euros for one, the fava lead and chorizo croqueta which was light and airy and rather odd but tasty. The cured duck toast was ok as was the salt cod egg.We had the olive oil poached tuna conserva (12), it was fine if not at all at the level of a traditional conserva in terms of flavour.Octopus & Salsa Verde (12) this was probably the best dish we had and more reflective of modern Spanish food, very thin slices of octopus with tiny cubes of kohlrabi and avocado with micro greens. It was simple and refreshing dish.Mussel buñuelos (7) these fritters are not like those common in Mexico nor are they like the ones you find in Catalonia or Valencia but they were very delicious and come out warm and freshly made. The Charcuteria plate at 19 was uninspired.While the food was undeveloped, they have put a lot of thought into the wine and cocktail selection and it felt like the focus was more on the drinks than the food in terms of development.Decor- The space had a full remodel yet there seemed to be no thought given to sound baffling, accessibility or functionality. The main entrance is not wheelchair accessible and the wheelchair accessible door is kept locked with the person in a chair having to either get someone else to unlike the side entrance or some how get the attention of the greeter. But even once they got in it would hard to maneuver. The tables were close enough together at the banquet side of the dining room that tables had to pulled out for people to sit down. While we were there both tables next to us asked if the music could be turned down and both times it was turned down only to be turned up again. Even with the music down both the diners and the servers were screaming to be heard. The lighting is attractive but ineffective. Without a doubt this is the worst restaurant in SF for sound.Service-It's the first week so there are going to be service issues but there seemed to be no training for the staff. Dishes were dropped off at our table and the ones next to us with no explanation or order. I was never sure who our server was. It seemed like the hostess and the general manager were also acting as servers. The table next to us got the wrong order, the other one got ignored and didn't get to order until after us. The service was just not with it at all.With two other restaurants within walking distance of this place doing decent to excellent Spanish, Catalonia and Basque inspired food this place really need to improve it's food unless it plans to just cater to hipsters and techies who want some bites to go with their drinking.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10327,"I thought I was in a sketch from Portlandia. If you want to line up for day old ""croissants"" served by surly ""baristas"" this is the place for you.It's been open two months but it still hasn't managed to make enough pastries for the entire 6 hours, five days a week they are open but they do manage to not wake up early enough to actually bake their pastries and instead bake them the day before and FREEZE them. I guess it's too much for hipsters to be so authentic as to actually bake their pastries the same day.  So to let's take a trip to hipster bakery shall we?We get there an hour before they are suppose to close. The sign says they are open. I see the baker outside talking to some rich hipsters. We go and ask what pastries are still available. The barista's reply is what ever is out is what is available. OK. There is nothing on the counter but they are making some kind of weird oversized croissant. So we say we'll  take one of those. Surly barista tells us those aren't available, they are being baked for tomorrow. It's 11am and these are being baked for tomorrow? WTF? I'm confused and ask so you serve day old pastries, she explain oh we freeze so they are totally fine. Yeah cause what makes day old pastries even better is freezing them! I don't see anything else so we say so what you are saying is there are no more pastries left. Umm why the hell couldn't she just say that? We decided to just get coffee since we are there and end up with coffee with about half a shot of coffee in it, maybe they were out of beans too?While we are waiting for the slowest coffee in the world a  group of young women come and not seeing anything ask if there is a menu of the pastries they do have. Surly barista replies we don't do that, whatever is out is what we have available. They look around a bit confused and I have to turn to them and say that they have no more pastries. One of the girls thinks I'm joking because she like most sane people assumes that the people that actually work there would say that. Barista girl just keeps on ignoring them. As we leave I see barista girl take two of the croissants that she claimed were for the next day and give them to the hipsters that are talking to baker owner. I don't feel bad I didn't try the pastry as I realized it's the same overpriced, overcooked pastry served at Front. And that folks is the very epitome of a douchy hipster business. I guess this is some joy in knowing that people paying insane prices for day old frozen pastry unless you are besties with owner and then you don't even have to pay!",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10344,"Do you like Jesus? Do you like dates? Bet you never thought they went together but in the garden of Shields Date Garden they do! And it's just as whacky as it sounds.I think most of the reviewers never went past the store in front and so they missed on the magical mystery walk of Jesus's life as told by at times rather creepy statues. The store in front is a pretty typical hodge-podge of date products and lots of kitchsy crap. To tour the garden you have to either pay $5 dollars a person or buy 25 worth of food at the cafe or store and we end up eating the cafe.I like a garden, sculpture, rock, Japanese, I'm there. But I think I draw the line on a literal Jesus Garden. I love meditation gardens, church gardens but this is not that. I had no idea of what it was but now I know and I can not un-see this display of ""Christian Art"".But the garden, oh the Jesus loving Garden. Basically it is walk through the J-man's life as told in vignettes with stone statues. Whoever did the landscape did an excellent job, there is beautiful concrete and stone work, walls and fountains and a freaking small lake with fountains, the only thing that takes away from it is such cheerful sites as a life size Jesus on the cross or a not at all homoerotic coupling of Jesus getting baptisted. It's fun to make out in Jesus's tomb complete with stone casket! In short if you love you some Jesus and have already bought 25 dollars in food, get on in there. If not it's an easy miss. It is fully wheelchair accessible even up to the ""mount"" with the giant Jesus statue from when he arose on the 3rd day. The bathrooms are also wheelchair accessible.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10348,"I paid $16 for half a slice of brisket that didn't even weight a 1/4 of a pound and a tiny scoop of pulled pork and I say scoop because it was so shredded that is formed almost a paste. Without a doubt the most over hyped and underdelivering BBQ in the Bay and there are a lot of competitors for that crown. 8 dollars for 1/2 a slice of brisket!TL:DR review-If you like spending a lot of money on a tiny portion of fairly average BBQ-come here! If not go to B-side in Oakland or Cathead's BBQ in SF. Both of them cost far more than what you get at a BBQ joint outside the Bay Area but at least you get a medium size portion.Longer WTF is this crap review-I was fully expecting to pay too much for BBQ, at least 20 bucks and it still not be as good as the average Q in the Carolinas, Texas or even Virginia but I seriously can not believe what they are serving here. What kind of bizarro world is it when this place gets acclaim for serving brisket that was dry and pulled pork that was overcooked to death (which shouldn't even be possible). The seasoning seemed to be the same both the pork and beef which is just bizarre. I tried to order a 3 meat with brisket, ribs and pulled pork only to be told that ribs aren't a meat choice. Then I tried to get the 3 meat with the foie gras sausage even said I would pay extra. Nope they couldn't do that although she said the foie gras sausage was served in their ""poutine"" which was fries with the sausage on top. NO. THAT IS NOT POUTINE HIPSTER GIRL.I settled for 2 meats, pulled pork and brisket to go. When I got my order I check everything out. It wasn't in the usual square container and instead jammed into the tiniest french fry container was a tiny amount of pulled pork. I went back in to ask for the brisket to which hipster girl told me, it's underneath the pulled pork, which I lifted up to see on tiny half a slice of brisket. I actually asked her if that was the full size to which she said well it's 1/4 a pound of meat. SERIOUSLY, 1/4 a pound is a serving to them. But even that I didn't believe so when I got home I weighted the brisket, on my handy kitchen scale it was NOT 1/4 of pound.  So you don't even get the tiny amount they claimed to serve. Even if you are raising the pigs and cattle in 6000 a month hipster apartments it still would not cost this much for organic humanely raised meat.The sides were bland and some how they were able to know what regular portions of those are. To give you an idea my portion of potato salad was twice as large as my pulled pork.Brother-in-laws and it's follow up joint in this place  had a lot of issue, it' s was dirty and not in the hipster approved way, they ran out of meat but damn if their BBQ didn't taste the way it's suppose to be and if their portions were regular human sized.Also what kind of BBQ place serves cheeseburger?Decor-hipsterStaff-hipsterCustomers-white tourists and white hipsters parents and assorted other white folks that can eat BBQ at 3pm on Friday (ie, no office jobs for them).",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10356,"One of the first things I did when I landed in New Delhi for what ended up being a 8 month stay in India was eat some street food and drink a chai out of a tiny glass served on the side of the street. Eight months later it was some of the last food I ate. Street food can mean lots of different things in different parts of India. A thali is never street food but food you get a sit down restaurant.TL:RL Review-Indian inspired grab bag of food mostly under 12 dollar. Pluses is it's cheap and quick. Minuses is the food is pretty bland and boring. While it's not expensive it's more than you normally pay for a taco or a burrito. The food is extremely forgettable in terms of taste.While Curry Up Now bills it themselves as a ""indian street food"" it kind of misses at every level, whether it's going for inspriation from the many different cusines of the sub-continent. The menu has so many things on it, most of it not street food, what there is food common to mumbai with puri and vada pav.They also have a thali, well a very limited thali not the thali you find in many states in India with a dozen or more small servings of different dishes. The choices for the thali are a hodge podge of dishes most familiar to Americans and meat choice geared towards hipsters with pork belly as an option. Most dishes weren't horrible but avoid as the aloo paratha quesadillix which was just horrible.There is a saying the cheap comes out expensive. This place is a great example. With so many good choices, good enough shouldn't be one of them. Yeah I know there isn't good Indian food whether thalis or chatt in SF but I'd still avoid this place.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

Can not support an unsafe, unethical company that doesn't seem to care about it's customers, it's contractor drivers or basic things like legal privacy and honestly the service has been going down hill.When it first started, the cars were always clean, the drivers were polite and professional and knew where they were going and were willing to listen to route preferences but in the last 2 years I had one of them call me a faggot, other ones not wanting to go the route I want and in every city it was like a new potential for a bad experience and the customer service seemed to only have one solution-refund the fare, give you credit but they never did anything about the drivers whether training them or firing them and the customer service response was never genuine or concerned.The big reason I started using Uber was to have on time pick-up and good service and both of those have been lacking. Then you add to that the recent revelations that Uber VPs were considering snooping illegally into critical journalists' personal lives and trying to harm them personally and it's clear that Uber is a company rotten to it's core.No Thanks",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

10378,"On the plus side it wasn't expensive and it didn't make me sick and didn't taste horrible.The negative side is even compared to worst US sushi this was bad. It was so weird cross between a hand roll and a hosomaki neither of which are traditional sushi. It was thick hosomaki not cut into pieces and with the portion of rice to filling being way off. The rice also didn't  seem to be vinegar rice. I got salmon & avocado, tempura shrimp and tofu and mushroom the last was inari skin and unpickled mushroom. Dude offed me all kinds of wrong like to put on my sushi such as satay sauce and mayo but he thought I wouldn't want gari.

Horrible overpriced food. Dirty seats & no soundproofing so you can hear other theaters.Went here because it was the only place still playing a film I wanted to see. The website listed the film as playing at 8:30, when we got there close to the time, one of the many hipster white people working there said we must have read the wrong information because it was at 8:45. a quick check of their website showed she was the one wrong. We tried to buy tickets at first one register then another but their system was either down or over charged depending on who you asked so we sat around until we notice other people actually getting tickets. We ordered some food, a slice of pizza and some BQQ wings. They didn't have any canned regular soda only overpriced Italian soda. We tried to go in the theater after the counter person told it was open and the door was open only to have a another surly white staff person yell at us that the theater wasn't open and we should know since the door was closed (when another customers said it was open, surly staffer claimed he was lying. The idea is that you get a key that tells your server where you are located but I guess it doesn't work because instead the server went up and down the row while the movie was going asking if people had a number.I paid 9 dollars for 5 tiny drumsticks covered in a sticky sweet sauce, there was no wing and they weren't crispy or tasty. There was some kind of show going on during our film because we could hear noise during our film sometimes loud cheering.But the scummest behavior was when I saw that the only elevator had an out of order sign and asked how folks in wheelchairs can get to the second level that has most of the couches and comfortable seat. Both the white hipsters behind the counter laughed and said it was always out of order and that they could stay on the lower level.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10391,"Had I known this place was from the folks who brought us Tacolicious I wouldn't have been surprised by the mediocre food. Nothing was horrible but for every dish I could think of a better version of it for less money in the city. Instead you get a hodgepodge of average dishes for above average prices served in a trendy tech worker friendly setting.We tried a good chunk of the menu and most dishes had something wrong with them whether it was the too thick wrappers on the dumplings, lack of seasoning or too much seasoning. Yeah just not that good and while the prices seem cheap per dish since they are all same they add up. I'm fine with paying top dollar for excellent food but not for mediocre food.Having said that I am sure it will be a hit with new Mission crowd as they like anything ethnic wrapped up in a nice aristianally designed package.

The whole place is straight of the 80's and the front desk people really need an attitude adjustment. I'm guessing the rest of the year it is very cheap to stay here ($69) but it's not for SXSW.Room-small but updated and on the first floor, the bed were decent. The only window looked out to the parking lot and there was no sheer privacy curtain so it's either everyone look in your room or you have no natural light. The bathroom was a joke. The shower head was low for me and I am 5 ft tall. It's also in a tiny, tiny space with the toilet and original to the 1980's building. The hotel- has no airport shuttle, breakfast was edible if limited. The hotel is run down. The front sliding door got stuck and didn't open several times when we were there and the front desk people didn't seem to care.The staff- Unhappy people one and all. Not a single one of them cared at all or were polite. Some were actively rude. The majority of people staying were in town for SXSW but every morning was this dance of asking them to call a taxi and them taking their time. There was a shuttle stop at a nearby hotel but the front desk had no idea where or when it came and didn't seem inclined to tell people even after guests had given them the info.If you are going to SXSW this is a poor poor choice.

The Pizza Hut also does delivery for several of the hotels. Do not use them. The place is gross, I mean really really physically gross and dirty from the the counters, the booths, the building and that goes on to the food which was so horrible even for a chain.

I got a bacon cheese burger with onions. It was gross. The burger was so overcooked I couldn't eat it. The cheese wasn't even melted but then again since it wasn't really cheese more like a ""cheese product"" I shouldn't be surprised.The French Spouse got a grilled cheese sandwich which was two slices of processed cheese on hamburger buns.

When we complained that one of phones (on British sims btw) didn't work at all, the counter person said they could ""reset the routers and we should have wifi."" We tried to explain we were talking about network signal not their internal wifi, ""she responsed with the very helpful ""I don't know nothing about that stuff"" and that was it. Did I mention this place was built in the last five years and it's geared toward business travellers so there is no reason cell phones shouldn't have signal. She did say that we could upgrade for a fee to a room on the outside with better signal.-we booked a king size bed and when we got there they said we booked two twins which is impossible since I only came at the last minute on the trip. Not that it matter since the single king size bed and two twins were in the same category but according the reception there were no more king size bed in our catergory but they would be happy to upgrade us for an additional fee. Sound familar.-the first room we got was on the second floor, it was tiny with a tiny window that looked out on an indoor covered courtyard with cleaning supplies and tarped furniture as our view. There was no light at all and it was dark even with all the lights on. We immediately called to get another room and were told we would have to come in person to the reception again and once again were told that if we wanted to a window that actually looked outside we would need to upgrade for a fee.-we ended up on the fifth floor with the a larger window that faced the same indoor courtyard with window that were tinted so it was always dark in the room. the plus I guess was that we didn't need to sleep with the blinds closed even in the middle of the day.-the rooms are small and rather tacky in a trying to be hip but failing way. The furniture and bathrooms already showed signs of wear and tear and poor constuction. The floor was actually uneven which they tried to cover up with the cheap carpet.-The bathroom door wouldn't stay open so we had to use the trash can to keep it open. The bathroom was a good size but very cheaply built, there was a plastic tray bottom in the shower and the shower stall leaked. There was of course not enough light.-Although we didn't have the do not disturb sign out all the time, our room was never cleaned in the 4 days we were there. Which is funny because we could hear them talking on their mobiles all the time in the hallways.-The service was horrible, they got my spouse's gender wrong in person and on the forms even after being corrected. Business card were dropped off with the concierge before we arrived and they never notiflied us and when we called them they said we would have to come down cause they didn't know what we were talking about, sure enough they were there. There weren't umbrellas for the guests. I tried to ask the door man for directions and instead he told me he was just there to flag taxis. -We paid for the complete breakfast to be included. There was a huge que to be seated every morning and although they said we could also order pancakes and veggie sausage I was never once able to order anything and the one time the server took an order for veggie sausage and just never came back. The buffet was varied widely sometimes having very little choice to having quite few but almost all the food was pretty bad.-They are incredibly tacky and cheap, on the window in the elevator hallway which had the only window we saw looking out they have stickers that say ""If you like this view talk to our staff about paying to upgrade to room with this view."" Seriously trying to up sell with stickers on windows. The only good thing was the location. It is right by the Westminster Bridge and it was delightful to walk over the Bridge every day.After filling out the survey they send guest I got an email from a manage saying that I got what I paid for and that if I wanted a different room I should have paid one and offer to upgrade me on my next visit so I could experience it.

I went here cause I had heard there was a nice patio here and being as Oregon has a non-smoking workplace law I knew it would be a nice smoke free place. Imagine my surprise when I come out to a patio covered in cigarette with folks in their skinniest pants and unkept facial hair smoking up RIGHT IN FRONT of no smoking signs. Confused I deciding to ask the counter person once I could get her attention (she was too busy singing Country roads and talking to a hipster boy to do anything mundane as take a drink order and she explain that they had to put up those sign since some dared to call the city to enforce the law and that by having the signs, it wasn't their responsiblity if someone choose to smoke out there. Perfect white hipster logic there- we aren't going to follow the law but we are going to make sure we don't have to pay for breaking the law.The drinks are crap.They have a minimum for using a debit card even though there is no different in charge and it's a scam. The music is hipster ironic, played too loud and I'm guessing the barista is really ""a musician"" for the all the off key singing that she did to Dolly Parton whom she clearly loves but not enough to even learn all the words.Avoid this place unless you are a hipster, if you are you will love it and you can increase your cancer risk which is probably not a problem since some how even without jobs you manage to have health insurance.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

It wasn't until I was out of the shop that I realized there were gaps on the side of my finger nails without polish and that the upper portion of the French Manicure was very uneven. In short it does not look like a professional manicure.A couple of days later it's even worse. My toe nail is chipped and one of the gels came off completely on one finger.

Living in Potrero Hill with the same dozen restaurants for decades I just don't give a chance, I love when new places open or when improvements are made. However while Mission Rock Resort got a face lift in terms of decor and a new name, the food is incredibly bland and boring.We've been a few times now and it's been the same every time. Snobby managers/host who can't believe we didn't make a reservation, confusion of where we could sit (example saying that it would be 25 minutes for outside table, then sitting the next folks who came in outside or  doing the opposite to us).Don't bother coming for the 99 cent oysters at Happy Hour unless you are coming at 3pm because by 6pm they will all be gone. Maybe this is the new cool hipster trend to not have Happy Hour specials during Happy Hour.On to the food both at brunch and dinner. It's meh, the ingredients are good, the ideas are ok and yet most dishes are bland, bland, bland. Some examples:-the ceviche isn't cured enough and didn't have enough acidity.-the mac and cheese was super bland, creamy yes but almost no taste of cheese more of roux.-the po'boy sliders. WTF. putting on fried oyster between two buns does NOT a po'boy make not even if you are calling it a slider. I think they forgot to add remoulade on ours, they must have. -salmon benedict- the salmon seemed prepackaged and overall meh.In general all the food needs more seasoning and a bit more thought.  Friends felt it had gone down from when they first reopening in terms of taste and portions.Every time we've been there the servers have all been nice but seem either overworked or undertrained. Dishes come out in the wrong order, there are delays in service, etc. But I can't blame them since they are working for another owner who has no problem paying to remodel the place but doesn't think he should have to pay for health care (yup another restaurant owner trying to make a buck charging a healthy SF ""surcharge"", although they don't even have the balls to list it on the menu or bill.Still judging by the high lighted ponytails, google employees and guys in khakis I don't think they really care if Hill residents are going to go here.

My own chocolate chunk breading pudding is my go to dessert for a potluck.So I was excited to try Schulzies. What I tried was pretty disappointing. Cold bread pudding is just gross but I still tried it. The flavours were weak and the portions small. The small cold Caramel Charisma (and it is small) is $4.50 was just not good. The texture is far softer than most bread puddings and rather than being all about the creaminess of the dairy, it was overwhelmed by sugar. Some how it managed to soft without being creamy.Also I don't really get the toppings. The great thing about bread pudding is that you add whatever happens to be around, fruit, nuts etc to your bread pudding and it's a whole dessert right out of the oven. Needing to add anything other than maybe some whipped cream or a sauce is the sign of a poor pudding.We tried a warm version which was  marginally better in texture but still really lack in flavour. I can only guess they are so popular because they are such a unique concept for a business or because they've been on a Food Network show but I'll still to my own breading pudding which cost far less to make and tastes far better.

We went to the reception and asked to be moved into rooms that were equal sized and as shown in all their advertisement but were told they were fully booked and that the nice modern rooms were in the OTHER hotel that was contacted to them but has it's OWN reception, dining room and service and it was just random selection who gets what rooms.Even worse since we were both still working remotely and internet was a must we found we could not connect at ALL to the wifi in our rooms. We complained and they claimed to be ""fixing"" it but for our entire stay we never had wifi in our rooms. They told us we could use the wifi at the bar in the OTHER hotel but that closed at midnight and also did not have consistant signal. We complained again and were told a manger wouldn't be available until the next day.Other issues: They were still cleaning our room when we went in and the cleaning people told us to come back!The drain was broken on the bathroom sink and the toilet would keep making noise unless you hit the flush button. The shower floor was cracked. The TV reception was not clear. There was very little lighting and as I mentioned there was a musty smell. The only view was of the train station and it was not right next to the duomo as it was advertised. When we checked in, they never mentioned the much nicer hotel that was physically connect to the hotel and that we could eat there instead of at the much poorer restuarant in the Diplomat. My mother in law ate her breakfast at the Diplomat while we ate at the nicer attached hotel (breakfast is included at both but this was never mentioned) and the one at the attached hotel is MUCH better.We came by car and the only parking available was valet that was 25 euros for a 24 hour period.If you do come here be aware that they might charge you for a nice modern room and give you a nasty run down room. The manger ended up giving us a 10 percent discount which really just covered the tourist tax and was not enough compensation for the fraud that was committed.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

I don't expect good food, I do expect to at least get some service like having my order taken within a half hour.The food here is average to poor however on our last experience I can't rate the food since we waited 30 minutes at our table without even getting water let alone anyone taking our drink or food orders. I even went up to people just standing around (easy to do since there were 4 crew members just standing and talking) and asked about our server. One of the women pointed to our server and said well she's right behind you at that OTHER table if you want to talk to her and then said ""I guessing I can ask her if she needs help"". I go back to our table and the women I spoke to didn't approach our server and our server continued to ignore our attempts to get her attention. We left.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10543,"I wanted to love this place. As it was I didn't even really like it. Like that American chefs are mining Eastern Europe for inspiration, wish they were more successful. Issues:1.The server told us to get five dishes for two people which was far too much food. Three to four dish or even less if you get larger plates is more than enough.2. we had food that was cold, when it should have been warm and both times it appeared our food had been sitting. The smoked potatoes tasted ok but some of them were cold while some were warm. The portion was too large and I wish they did half-portions for half the price. I don't see the value of spending 9 dollars for a bowl of potatoes.3. the goulash was a very loose interpretation of goulash so loose that it shouldn't called that.4. It was if they took the ingredients of some East European food and made it more bland. This is not the food I've had in Budapest or Prague and if it is just taking inspiration there to make a new hybrid, it is sorely missing some flavour.5. The pescatarian spouse was going to get a the veggie soup until I was smart enough to ask what kind of stock it was. They use a meat stock for a veggie soup. Who does that. So if you are veggie or pescatarian I would double check that your vegetarian dish actually is.6. I did like the pickled items and I'm happy they jumped on the trendy pickling bandwagon.7. The bread of course was so good.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10558,"On the menu they state they do BBQ as only it can be done in San Francisco and if by that they mean very poorly then they got that down to a science. Of course what they go on to say is ""it organic and locally source meat and ingredients"" and this place proves once again that no matter how good the ingredients are, bad food is bad and the food at The Dancing Pig is really bad.How bad?We didn't finish a single thing we ordered. I had brisket ($15) that managed to be both too fatty and dry. I am not even sure how that happens. It was also was a small portion for the price but even with the small size I couldn't finish it because it was so dry. The brussels sprouts tasted like kerosine and they were super bitter and undercooked (and I don't like mushy sprouts). The mac and cheese was so horrible mess of overcooked pasta, super-thin white sauce and bland cheese flakes. The collard greens were horrible, just horrible but that's jot surprising for an SF BBQ place.  The pork managed to be greasy and still unflavourful. They do at least serve the meat undressed but all three sauces tasted off.While I have family roots in South Carolina and Florida, I deferred the final judgement to my dining companion a native of West Virginia who grew up in Tennessee who proclaimed it one of the worst BBQ in the Bay. Pretty much says it all.The two stars are for the great server we had.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

Unless you want to look like you are following the paleo diet without actually even following it or you like over paying for really basic bland food you can skip this place. Putting aside the fact that humans in the paleo era actually were doing  subsistence eating and lived less than 25 years on average, the so called Paleolithic diet consists mainly of local fish, wild meats, vegetables, fruit, fungi, roots, and nuts, and excludes grains, legumes, dairy products, salt, refined sugar, and processed oils, so I was surprised to see that much chicken and beef on the menu and coconut flour.  But since I don't give a crap about the diet I figured why not try it? The food was bland and boring. The salad especially were disappointing, small, not very fresh and prepackages (don't think that's how the caveman did it). The ckicken tenders were dry. The sauce was ok but could have used more seasoning.If you eat Paleo or want to impress someone who does, go here. If you like tasty food, you might want to skip it.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10570,I wish I had read the reviews first!We stopped here on our amazing northwest road trip and the countryside is beautiful but the food here wasn't. I like my burgers medium rare and my burger was so overcooked it could have been a charcoal brisket. The salad greens were sad and wilted. I wasn't expecting gourmet food but good honest bar and grill food and this sure didn't have it.The service was a joke. I wouldn't have thought they were Christians as the servers seemed to like the bar a lot and didn't seem very respectful or professional. It took a long time to get served and they forgot our drinks (soft drinks) and didn't bring them until after the meal.,D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10571,"I was super excited to try Basque food in one of the few places in the USA with a large Basque community but the food here was over fried, over salted and overpriced.The French Spouse has eaten Basque food many times in Europe and felt it missed the whole point of being having fresh from the farm and sea ingredients and a rather more skilled hand at seasoning. The crab cakes they serve here are nothing like authentic crab fritters in Basque county.  It's interesting to see what traditions have been kept and what have been changed to appeal to a rural American palate.Both the asparagus and the artichoke in the asparagus & artichoke dish tasted and looked like they came from a can which there is no need for when both are in season right now.I also agree it wasn't even close to cooking from the Basque region of Spain but I did like they had tripe and beef tongue on the menu and my tongue was cooked well but unfortunately the brown gravy was far too salty and I couldn't finish the dish. The nice part about Leku Ona was there are several patio areas and it's nice to eat outside on a warm summer evening. The service was amateur but super friendly and our server tried to be helpful.With prices in the 20's for entrees I expect fine dining service and food neither of which were present.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

No wonder they have a higher crime rate than most MAJOR cities in the entire country and another fun fact is five year almost the entire police force was sacked for illegal practices.This place is truly a dump in every sense of the word. Their claim to fame is Michael Vicks famous for being busted for dog fighting. It is a truly depressing place filled with ugly buildings, no local business, nothing but big box stores and fast food places. Most of the people who live in Newport News are either born there and can't escape or they are military contractors who hate being there.

10601,"I never knew there was a problem of fake unlicensed taxi in San Francisco. Now I do. I wish I had called 911 when this driver started threatening me.March I flagged down this taxi in Potrero Hill. It was a yellow and red SUV. The driver was a slender guy around 45 with a Mediterranean or Arabic appearance.  I notice immediatly that it smell like very strong tobacco or weed but he was not smoking. I asked if he took debit cards as I had no cash on me.  He said yes and I gave him the address. I noticed he was taking a different route and I asked him to take me via Fell to my destination but he said he wasn't going to and he knew the right way.When we got to the location, I handed him the card and that's when things went to hell. He asked me how much of a tip I was giving him and I said I just wanted to pay the fare. He said if I wasn't giving him a tip that I had to pay in cash and I told him I didn't have cash and that I just wanted to pay. He still had my atm card in his hands and wouldn't give it back. He said I had to go to an atm machine and he had my card so he knew I could. He then claimed that the machine was broken and I told him I knew it was working, then he said that he would be charged 5 percent and have to report the earning. I told him I didn't care and that if he could either run the card and get paid, give back my card and not get the fare or we could call the police and that I wanted his badge number. That's when I realized that he had no fare sheet nor taxi badge displayed. He freaked out and swung his arm back and threaten and called me fag. I started dialing 911 and then suddenly he runs my card through the ""broken"" card machine and throws the card at me screaming faggot get out of my car before I kill your fag ass. I grabbed my card shocked and dashed out of the car but he stayed there screaming out the window that all the fags should be killed and he wanted to it. I tried to take a picture of the car and the license plate but he speed away.I called the taxi commission and found out that there is no Red & White taxi company register in San Francisco and they have no record of that company have a taxi license.

Another addition on the upscale burger joint Greenburger's burgers may be organic but they were bland and mealy.The decor is basic hipster with some retro thrown in. The service is counter service and friendly. The menu is pretty basic and uncomplicated. The burgers aren't very good and nor were the other dishes we had. I ordered my burger medium rare and it arrive unevenly cooked with it very well done on one side, almost raw on the other. I do send it back and they cooked the raw side more rather than give me a new one.The French Spouse had the vegetarian Sloppy Joe which she had never heard of and was fascinated by the concept. For being served with a tangy chili bbq sauce she still found it pretty bland and it was lukewarm when she got it.We also had sweet potato fried and onion strings neither of which were that good.The best thing was the salted caramel milkshake for 6 dollars. It was very good and they even do half sized for half price although the full size wasn't that big.Greenburger's uses sustainably sourced, environmentally conscious products whenever possible and they really want you to know because on every table is a card with all their vendors and even has a sign in the bathroom about how the hand soap is made for cooking oil. However intent is not magic and just wanting to cook with ""good"" ingredients doesn't make you a good cook.  Greenburger is a great example of this.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

It can get rather noisy with both the children, very loud music and the drinkers.There's not much to say about the food, it was overpriced and didn't taste good.

The W Los Angeles- Westwood however does not live up to it's brand.-the biggest issue is we had requested a room with bathtub and had even confirmed it by phone the two days before. We get to hotel and they give us a room with a shower. We call down to the front desk and the women apologized and said it was indeed on our record that we requested a bathtub. Meanwhile the gentleman who checked us in came with keys to new room with a tub and he claimed it was never on the record. Really a bad way to act.-the bathroom are subpar. Both the bathroom in the first room and in the second was TINY. There wasn't even a fan in the bathoom and since there was no window and no way to keep the door open it was extremely steamy. The tub was tiny and plastic and looked like it was from a Motel Six.-It was nice to have separate bedroom and sitting room but the ceiling height is so LOW and the windows so TINY that both rooms were dark even during the day.-the pool was closed the entire time we stayed there and they did not tell us that in advance even though we had confirmed that there was a pool just two days before. They did not to accomodate for the pool not being open.-The actual building from the outside is quite ugly and has none of the good design of most W hotels.+the good things about this hotel is the size of the rooms.

Add to that the sticky tables, the ripped up seats and the staff that seemed to want to do anything other than pay attention to customers. Most of the dishes have meat or seafood in them so I wouldn't bring a vegetarian or vegan here.We got pad thai and  Nem Cua crab mushroom egg  rolls. We wanted to get other things but they were out of oysters, couldn't make other rolls vegetarian etc. The pad thai was really bad, the seafood tasted frostburned and old and the rolls were super greasy.  The food was overpriced and not good.We ordered two Iced Coffees, they only brought one and it was super bitter.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

10627,"Don't believe the hype, the emperor has no clothes. Just because you are using organic and local ingredients does not mean the food tastes good or the chef knows how to prepare. If you are one of those people who feels morally superior by eating only organic and local then you will love this place. If you actually judge food by taste you will be disappointed. We love organic local food but that has more to do with my spouse being raised in France where all the produce is by law organic and me being raised rural and growing my own food. The current hype is rather disgusting as it only seems to lead to food cost increasing and a fetishizing of something that should just be common sense.Flat out almost every dish we got just wasn't that good. I was thrilled to see duck on the menu. I'm grew up eating wild duck but have come to love farm raised duck too. Both my starter and my entree had duck and both were improperly cooked. The starter was duck legs. One of the best thing about duck is the crisp beautifully fatty skin and the lovely moist meat. The skin on the legs was not crispy and the meat was so dry! There was no seasoning to speak of and while the portion was huge, I didn't even eat half of it.The French Spouse got the tuna tartar a dish straight from 2000 based on the server's reccomendation and it was bland boring unseasoned dish that has no place on a modern menu. Our entrees were equally disappointing. My duck breast was chewy and while the portion was large again it was so poorly cooked I didn't bother to finish it. The spouse's vegetarian dish, crispy hodoy soy tofu, yuba, carrots, okra, curry emulsion  was a bit of a crime against vegetarian food.They literally took two huge slabs of tofu, barely seasoned it and served it as is on mixture that was slighty more seasoned although the curry was pretty bland and the tofu was not crispy. It was something a teenager new to vegetarian food would make.The food was so bad that I did something I rarely do and didn't even bother to try the desserts. This place is listed as being in Bernal Heights when it is on MISSION and in the mission. If atmosphere felt like it did not belong in the Mission and like it was gear to the newer hipster residents of the Mission even if the owner did grow up in the same building. If you are a person that thinks eating organic and local makes you a superior person and radical then you will love this place.  It's clearly marketed to the hipsters and wealthy gentrifiers who love the mission best when it's kept at an arms length. It has not one but two communal tables, lots of wood and lots of ""upcycled"" decor that probably cost more than some folks' rents.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

For the two vegetarian there was only one vegetarian entree and it was clearly an afterthought with no protein in it. The pescatarians didn't fare well either as the fish was over cooked but that was true for most of the food. We tried all the specialty including the Feijoada which was far more salty than other Feijoada I have had and most people ended up not being able to eat much of it even though it was filled with meaty goodness. We did like the appitizers of fish balls and meat balls as well as the sausage by the foot.

10636,"The pathetic service and subpar food that I ate here was all the more evident three days later when I was eating at Le Bernardin and Eleven Madison Park. There I was treated like royalty while at Wheatfields a mediocre Italian restaurant in a small town with a big ego the hostess acted like she had stepped in crap when she saw us come in.I had made a reservation for me, the French Spouse and two of the French Spouse's coworkers who are located in upstate New York. Upon arriving a few minutes early I went to check in with the hostess and to see if the rest of our party was had already arrive. Well the hostess acted like I had just killed her cat and complained that we were five minutes early and why would she know where our party was especially since they were very busy and our reservation would be seated late. I was pretty put off by her tone and behavior but didn't think much of it until after she came to seat at our table and instead of seating us in the dining room took us to the bar area and gave us a booth there. If I had wanted to eat at a bar I wouldn't have made reservations for a table. I asked her if we could be moved to a table in the dining room which I reserved but she didn't even say a word and just walked away. Even the coworkers, one of whom is the editor of a major news outlet noticed her behavior and suggested that maybe we just go somewhere else. In hindsight we should have gotten up and just left because the meal and service after that were a joke. First we didn't have server come for almost 15 minutes then when he did he thought we had already ordered our drinks and wanted to take our meal order. The food all came out at different times with a salad coming out ten minutes before any other appetizer and the same thing happened with our entrees. Almost all the food was at the level of an olive garden, the pasta didn't appear to be freshly made and nothing had proper seasoning. The risotto was so gummy and bland, I can't imagine what chef would allow it to leave the kitchen.I used come here as a teenager growing up here and the pasta being good but I can not remember a time in the last 2 decades of eating all over the world since then when I have dealt with worse service and behavior and the food was nothing like those fond memories.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

It tasted like the food a new vegetarian would make rather than an actual chef in a restaurant.The produce wasn't that fresh and the rice was overcooked.The service was non-existent with the server spending most of the time at the odd bar in the center hanging out with her friend.It's also located in what looks like a rec room in a random condo or office building.,D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10654,"Not sure if our experience was just an oddity but we did not have a good stay here.It's a great place if you can sleep through music being played at night and street noise. If you expect to have peace and quiet I wouldn't come in here in the summer when there seems to be a constant stream of drunk loud people walking on the street, the neighbors are playing music during the night and they (folks on the street/some neighbors) seem to have no consideration for people sleeping.Our room was in the front of the house and on the lower floor so that may also be a factor.I do appreciate that after I sent an email at 3am about the noise that I got an email in the morning saying they were comping us the room since we had such a poor night.Not to mention the train horns that seemed to blare every hour.The place looks clean and simple. You have to share bathrooms and the bathrooms aren't anything fancy.  Everything is well kept. I found the beds too hard but our room was certainly large, clean and comfortable.They have juice and breakfast stuff available for self-serve in the morning.I go to bed and breakfasts and guesthouses for a local feeling but the only feeling I got from this place was tired.UPDATE: I received a negative email from Stephen one of the co-owners (who does not live on site, although there is a live-in manager) about this review in which he dispute my experience while at the same time saying that they have air conditioners and fans to block any noise. As it was not warm I feel that it is silly to have use an air conditioner as a noise cancellation device but perhaps in the future they can tell people that in advance. Also to be clear his bald headed neighbor on the right was only loud and playing music for a short time at 2:40 in the morning and there was other additional music from across the street  that had bass going for hours as well as at least 4 instances of noisy/drunk? people outside.   I do not expect them to be able to control all their neighbors and that is why I feel it is important to note what kind of street noise there is. He also claimed that my spouse said she had a great time to the manager there rather than the reality that she was trying to be polite and said the place was nice but the it was noisy and that she was able to get some sleep unlike me who got none. This was with both of us wearing earplugs.This is not a reflection on the guest house's owners who while they are not actually there in person and I never even met I am sure are lovely professional people. I am disappointed how after acting professional, they are now calling my account a lie.

10660,"Tcho is amazing chocolate, at least that's what their marketing and branding people say and it must be true right? Not really.ok ok, the chocolate's not that bad and is a huge step up from mass produced chocolate but this company seems to be 90 percent marketing and 10 percent chocolate at least according to the tour I recently did.Went on the currently free tour although since the factory wasn't in production, there wasn't much to see. Instead we sat through video where it was explained that happened when the creator decided to make a chocolate company, he thought first about what the brand should be and how should they package it, this is all before he actually bother to you know make any chocolate bars.They also kept on going on how different and revolutionary they are ignoring that in Seattle there is a fully organic fair trader chocolate maker who does the same single source chocolates as do several other smaller chocolatiers. Independent chocolate makers are almost as popular as cupcake stores.Of course the big difference is that TCHO is much more expensive and that those companies aren't run by the former publishers of Wired magazine who seem a bit consumed with marketing and considering they have a distribution deal with Starbucks these folks are far from small time chocolate makers.I love dark chocolate and plain chocolate and thier chocolate is good but not great. The only product they had that was better than other independent small scale chocolatiers were their nibs. Their are far more nutty and less bitter than most I've tried.I also had the hot chocolate that was served too hot (not a big deal, most people make hot chocolate too hot) and liked it enough that I got a tin to make at home.Also the girl on our tour had little knowledge about chocolate outside of their process in the factory. Some of her facts about chocolate were just plain wrong and she couldn't answer basic questions about chocolate making.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

I have friends that work there and some of the workers are great but there are so many workers with attitudes.Tonight was just another example of crappy behavior that almost always comes from the straight white guys that work there. The French Spouse and are there for our shopping trip and she's doing her ""take pictures of things to amuse myself"" so I can do the shopping when Mr. Attitude in the produce section who was hitting on a customer starting tell my wife ""sir, sir you can't take pictures here, it's against our corporate policy"" and then when she explains that she always does, Mr. Attitude goes on that he has worked here for 10 year and that if she wants to take pictures, she needs to get a press pass. Besides the fact that dude has some how managed to live in SF for a decade without knowing what a butch looks like, he was 100 percent WRONG. The French spouse went to the information desk and talked to media person and sure enough it's 100 percent ok to take pictures so long as no people are in them.I don't know what Mr. Attitudes problem is but using ""corporate policy"" in a co-operative business is just slimy as was he.Other things that kinda suck about Rainbow.Their produce is more expensive than some produce from the producers offered at the farmer markets.They stopped having discount days and coupons.Their garlic and onions have often been rotten on the inside.It is totally hit and miss trying to get assistance here, some people especially the cheese folks and the cashier are nice and helpful but other look like it's a crime to even dare to look at them.I do go there far less than I used to. We buy as much as we can at the farmer's markets when we can go there and we go to Trader Joe's for other things.

10672,"This hipster burger place looks great but just isn't worth the prices.If you know how to cook a good burger yourself or make a good milkshake then there really isn't any reason this place should impress you.The food is good, not great but good. I did like my lamb burger stuffed with feta which I asked for medium rare and got served medium rare. But to pay 9 dollars for a burger and not even get fries with that, I am just not that much of a hipster to be ok with those prices. Having root beer from the draft is great but paying 4 dollars for a single mug of root beer is not ok, ever.The service was neither good nor bad. I didn't need anything and I got my food. I went in thinking it was tiny 50's style's local hamburger place but what it actually is a little retro styled modern luxury burger hipster joint with a huge bar, lounge and patio in the back. There are arcade games and skee ball (which I love but am being to think must be a hipster bar must have in NYC). It looked like it would be a fun place to chill with friends but I don't think I would great another burger here.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

Anywhere else say San Francisco or Seattle, this wouldn't be considered any thing other than an average economy Indian place.We went for the buffet which is an freaking institution in the south. The buffet like most things in the house was full of meat and light on vegetarian options. the naan was cold and soft while the dishes were standard northern Indian fare like tandoori and mattar paneer. There is almost no spices used and it's pretty bland. You know it's geared for the noobs when they have things with spice levels.The food isn't horrible for Newport News, it would considered bad compared to any place that had any decent food but that's not Newport News.If you use to considering how worth will food is by how many PLATES of food you got then you will love the buffet there.

10689,"Depressing is the word that best describes the Travelodge in Newport News. The sole reason I am staying here is it is the closest to the location I need to be at. Like most of Newport News it is ugly and looks rundown. But even for this dump of a town, it's really the bottom of barrel. Half the doors seem to be broken probably because when people forget to pay in advance for the room, they deactivate the key card without telling you so people probably damage the door trying to get.Reason why this place is to be avoided as much as possible.1. it is next to the loudest, cheapest car wash in the world, you will here music blasting all day long.2.the patrons seem to be of a very unsavory character and they appeared to be under the influence of some mind altering substance.3. the cleaning staff is incredibly loud in the mornings and the linens are a joke, I actually got a towel that had large holes in it and the ""clean"" linens smelled like smoke. Another towel had orange stains on it.4.non-smoking rooms that are actually smoking rooms with ashtrays. first of all, smoking rooms are just gross but to lie about a room being a non-smoking room is so shady.5. you have to pay in advance. how creepy and bizarre is that. the place is cheap. you can stay for a week for less than the price of one night at the W or boutique hotel.6. The cleaning staff left my door open, luckily I brought all valuables with me when ever I left here.7. the final confirmation that this is a place to avoid is when my taxi picked me up to take me to the airport, the girl looked at me and said why are you staying at the crack motel?The only good aspect of the place is that the there is free wifi and cable TV.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

I went to this store in Newport News because I needed a suit for a funeral yet even with money in hand I still didn't get one here.Almost as soon as we entered the store and approached the salesman I could tell it wasn't going to be pleasant experience. He was busy chatting up his female coworker and even though I told him I was planning on buying a funeral suit, he didn't seem the least interested in making the sale. I gave him my criteria and in a store with thousands of suits he claimed there was only one suit that would fit me and even then after I had resigned myself to it, he said they didn't have my size after having already had me try on the jacket. When I then suggested that I just buy a sports coat from the store to were with some gray dress slacks he claim they would look horrible unless they were bought together. If I hadn't been clear that he has no interest in making a sale, that did the trick and we left without a suit.We did however go to another Men's Wearhouse that was less than 2 miles away and bought a suit there.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10692,"This used to be my go-to place for thai food in the Castro but the quality has really gone down over the last 2 years.The food used to be really good and the location can't be beat. Located right across from the Castro theater in surreal modern decorated former victorian flat it has a large menu with two pages of vegetarian options all at very reasonable prices. The most expensive dishes are around 12 dollars and most are under 10. The sad thing is that quality of the food has really gone downhill. The last two time we went the food was lukewarm and the seafood and the tofu was rubbery. Both the stuffed shrimp and the tofu for the tofu satay tasted like it has been cooked and frozen and then just heated up again. Dishes that used to be really good were just average and some were down right not tasty at all.The service has also gone downhill. There doesn't seem to be a lot of communication between the staff about who has just arrived, who is waiting to order and if people are still waiting for dishes.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

If you need gluten free food then this is a great place for you, for the average diner there is nothing to justify the prices.Just because you have table clothes and a modern decor doesn't make you a fine dining establishment or justify charging 18 dollars for a dish you can get for 9 dollars causal Vietnamese restaurant.The only dish that stood out as above average was Goi Cuon Ca, the fish rolls which were fresh and full of big chunks of fried fish.For our entrees we got the garlic tofu and the Bo Hanh Huong beef wrapped around scallions. Both of the dishes were pretty standard fare and not worth the 5-8 dollars more for them than what we normally pay.They made a big deal when we arrived that most of the tables were reserved but in the hour we were there, the majority of the restaurant was empty.With so many other Vietnamese restaurants in the city, the only reason I would come here is I was dining with a gluten-free friend.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10697,"There was massive lack of soul in this soul food place and there was way too much bad seafood.I can understand why Farmerbrown is popular with hipsters as they like going to places that look like dives while paying a lot for the food. I personally prefer places that look nice and are cheap or expensive just so long as the food is real good. The lighting was so poor we couldn't see the menus and it looked like they were actually trying to make the place look homey but instead it's some kind of faux styling that is anything but homey. It was also freezing the night we went there.Then some of the food we had was borderline inedible. The only thing that was good was the leek bread pudding but even that was good not great and the cheese was pretty mild.The entrees were so bad we didn't finish either of them. My spouse got the fried catfish and the fish tasted like it had been frozen and was frost burned. The hush puppies were just dry and hard. The green beans were over cooked. She didn't get through one piece. The dish I had was listed as Dungeness Crab with dirty rice which was actually Dirty rice with a couple of chunks of crab in it. The taste of the crab was overwhelmed by the seasonings which were strong but it had no of the complex flavours of the dirty rice that I use to eat in South Carolina. There was a good assortment of shrimp and clams but the shimp tasted frost burned and was very rubbery. Also for dirty rice it have very little Andouille. I left most of it uneaten. So much of everything was just off. I'm far from an expert on southern food even though everyone else in my immediate family lives south of the mason dixon now and my inlaws are sixth generation Louisianians. But I am sure that while I know what a good corn bread muffins tastes like I couldn't make right either and that how most of the food we had at farmer brown's tasted. Watered down and slightly off.We also had house made tart lemonade that was sweet not tart and house made ginger beer that had no carbonation and tasted more like iced ginger tea than any southern ginger beer.Considering the menu is tiny, it's surprising how bad the food was and considering that on it's website it promotes using local and fresh ingredients I was surprised the condition of the seafood.Not to mention that the food here is far more expensive than other casual soul food places and other high end restaurants like 1600 Fillmore do upmarket soul food better.There is no way I would come back here.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10700,"Having been raised eating BBQ in South Carolina, Kentucky and all over the east coast, there is no way BBQ in San Francisco can be anything but slightly disappointing and I don't expect competition BBQ at a local joint but I do expect edible meat. I don't know what disappointed me the most, the crappy ribs or the ridiculous prices.The sole highlight was the texas style rib which was one huge meat bone and it was tasty! I got the Big Blue which was 25 dollars for three meats and 2 sides and it was additional 4 dollars to get the texas style ribs. The other two meats I got were the pulled pork and the brisket both of which should be fork tender and melt in your mouth. They were both really tough and it seemed like there were so many BBQ sauces to pick from to help soften up and flavour the meat. I went back again think perhaps they just got some poor meat or just rushed the smoking and cooking process but it has the same toughness.The sides were equally disappointing, the collard greens were bitter, the okra slimey and the creamed spinach was runny and all three were served cold.Combined the low quality of the food with high prices this not a place I would return for a third time.Both times we went there, there no more than a dozen people there but the service was non-existant and it was very cold inside.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10703,"I was wondering what a restaurant in a good location and that had been fairly successful was doing a deal on blackboardeats.com. After the experience I had there I understand it better. It gets 3 stars for the food, 4 stars for the decor and design, 2 stars for the prices and zero for service.0 stars for service: Blackboardeats is a site that gives you 30% off your bill at participating restaurants. Restaurants choose to be involved and they can even set conditions like how much people have to spend. Here's the problem, they decided to do the promotion and then the servers and the restaurants acted poorly to the people using them. No only do they not get new customers but they actually can make sure people never come back.Now I go out to high end restaurants the way a Marina girl buys shoes or get their highlights touched up. With or without a discount I go out to eat all the time to fine dining restaurants. Using things like opentable, groupon or blackboard usually just makes me more willing to try out places I haven't been. So one of the problems at Farina is they decided to put automatic gratuity of 18 percent on all blackboardeats diners. That's their choice although considering I never give less than 20 percent (as a teen I tried to waiter and it was seriously one of the hardest job I ever had) it's their loss. What I have a problem with is the server never mentioned it, we put down an additional tip before I checked the bill for something else and realized we had been charged it and when I questioned the hostess she claimed it was on the blackboardeats details on the web offer. It is no where to be found on the offer! I even double checked with the management of blackboardeats to make sure that it wasn't in fine print.Also when we got there early they put at us the bar and then didn't seat  us until after our reservation time even though the restaurant was far from full and there was several 2-top available.Our server was rather cold and got colder through out the meal. We both ordered dishes with truffles and he said they would come out and shave the truffles in the amount we wanted at 10 dollars a gram yet when we got the dishes mine already had truffles on it and then my spouse was half way through her dish when they came to grate truffles on it (she got two grams and that was on the bill while mine I guess were included in the 34 dollar price of my dish. When I did tell him we had a code, he sneered and said ""about half the people we've had lately have those codes"" clearly quite pissed off about it. Again the restaurant choose to do the promotion, the customers are not at fault for using it.Usually service is a non-issue for me when dining because everyone has bad days and frankly so long as there is good food, I am very happy but this is clearly an ongoing problem here.Now on to things I did like, the space is designed wonderfully and when I saw they had a private dining room upstairs I was already thinking about it as option for an upcoming party. There is great lighting, nice arrangement of tables and the space is open and airy. It get four stars and would be five if the airconditioning hadn't been on in November.The food is a solid 3 over all. Some of it was really good but the entrees were very boring and forgetable and overpriced for both the quality and size.We started with calimari on a pesto puree. It was probably the best thing we ate. the contrast of the textures of the puree with calimari was great and the taste of the pesto was exceptional.Our meal went down hill from there with a gnocchi gratin that was 24 dollars to start with and then my spouse spent 20 dollars on truffle which were completely overpowered by the cheese. It was too big and rich to be a starter but two small and without an accompanments to balance the richness. It was would have so much better server with an arugula  salad.I got the Veal Saltimbocca which was 34 dollars and while the portion was generous, it could have been smaller and cheaper. It was good but far from great and again the truffles were lost due to the overly salty sauce.The dessert was really good and creative and I would have it again in a heartbeat but since I'm never going back due to the service, that's not to be. It was vanilla bean pannacotta with candied pumpkin seed and a pumpkin sauce underneath. It was simply perfect.The food for the price put this in the maybe category for me but the service puts it in the never will I go back category.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10704,"Well I can guarantee that the duck used to make the burritos is cooked in house because I got a one inch piece of duck bone in my burritos. When I called and complained the guy said he would give me half off my next purchase.

You can be assured that while the entire staff is latino the people making the money off the business are French folks who own the business. Just to make it clear if you don't understand sarcasm I LIKE the Mission and the taquerias there. Sure there can be great taquerias outside the Mission but even the average Mission taqueria is better than 99% of taquerias elsewhere in the city or in the state.But leaving aside the price, the ethics or the fact there was a BONE in my burrito (see pictures) let's talk about the taste of the burritos. The duck confit was tasty but the rest of the burrito was horrible. It was overcooked, unseasoned and a mushy mess. Did I mention it was also 9 dollars for super burrito? Sure it's a couple of blocks from my flat but there is no way I am ever going back here. Love Chez Maman and Chez Papa but this is a hot mess that will  no doubt be popular with those folks that love to get even their tex-mex as watered down as possible.If you hate real tex-mex, get scared going to the Mission or can only eat in places with wine lists then this place is perfect for you.edit: after posting this I got a threatening crude pm from user ""dan""yelp.com/user_details?us…, who not surprisingly has five star review for all the potrero hill restaurants owned by the same folks as the owners of papito and nothing but negative reviews for the other place on the hill. seriously not the way to do business.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

It was so noisy on weekday at 8pm that we almost decided to not stay for dinner.The dishes that did stand out were the Berkshire pork cheeks ""sous vide"" collared greens, maple-bourbon yams. I found it funny that promoted the cooking technique so much. I find meat can be just as good cooked in traditional method as in a water  immersion cooker. While the meat was perfect the yams and collared green were horribly cooked and the green were some how both sour and mushy at the same time.Likewise my spouse's Pan Roasted Black Cod was decent but not worth the 24 dollars it cost and was a rather flavourless dish.The house made gnocchi was nothing for any house to be proud of.This is place is really a bar that also servers food than restaurant and bar with most the people seemed to be more interested in drinking than eating.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

Maybe it was the video gambling machines inbedded in the bar or the employees doing nothing and giving everyone the stinkeye while smoking outside.We went here on a holiday monday at 10pm because there wasn't much open in Reno that wasn't in a bar or wasn't a greasy spoon. We need a place that would have some veggie or seafood choices for my wife and a place that had some decent food. Not such an easy thing to find in Reno on a holiday, a monday and at 10pm.The food really isn't that bad and I would probably have given it three or four stars if we hadn't both gotten stomach aches and sick right after eating here. We both eat the spinach salad and my guess is someone didn't bother to wash it before using it or had dirty hands when making it. I had the sirloin steak that was bit overcooked since I ordered it medium rare but it was tasty and was a larger serving. The roasted aspargus with it was overgrilled and the potatoes may have been fake but they tasted great.The salmon fish and chips my spouse got were tasty enough to be all eaten quickly.The service was pretty horrible. There were only two tables going when we got there but we still stood around for a while before a guy we never saw again told us to seat ourselves. Our server clearly did not want to be there and was pissed when we didn't order alcohol. She forgot to bring us our salad and it was served with our main dishes and she forgot to bring us utensils. There was never more than four tables occupied the entire time we were there and she spent most of the meal hanging out with the two kitchen staff guys at the bar.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

It wasn't even half full when we went but she made a big production about having to look for a table for three people and then never seemed to tell the server we were there. The food was very inconsistent in terms of quality, in timing of it coming out and with them forgetting things we ordered again! While there are one or two good dishes, there are so many misses we will be making a beeline to Umi right up the street.

The ones in Seattle, Vancouver and Europe have all been great and I have used them through out the years when I've been in those cities.The principle is great. rather than just leaving stuff outside or taking it to good will you post stuff you have to the list and people contact and in theory come and pick it up.people can also post for things they want.The way that ALL the other freecycle groups work is that people can't just post dozens of things they want and it's expected that you try to offer things as well. Also with every other freecycle group you can post pictures of the object in the photo album. Of course the SF one doesn't let you do it.Not the SF one where almost all the posts are people wanting things for free  and not just anything. No it has been organic fabric, solid wood construction and delivery would be great too. Yes all for things they are asking for.I've posted maybe a dozen things there from small objects to carpets and furniture. It proved to be a bigger hassle to give the things away than just put them on craigslist and put them outside. About half the people never showed up, other people wanted to come and check it out first to see if was worthy of them getting it for free.I guess none of them has ever learned the whole beggers can't be choosers but then again they all seem to believe that anything they want should just magically appear for them. I blame it on ""The Secret"" and stupidity.maybe that's the reason so few people actually post things on freecycle and the free section of craigslist is so much more popular.

You probably also think 12 dollar burgers and 15 dollar individual pizza are great ways to save money when eating out in this recession.2) you think leggings are a perfect substitute for actual pants or a skirt.3) you pick place based on whether they have been featured many time on Food Network ( one girl in the line actually said that).4) you think drowning food in sauce makes it better.I had only heard about this place from the people who live in the neighborhood it's in who told me how rude the customers were and judging from the choice group I was in the two times I was there I agree. I felt 10 percent douchier just being there.while I was waiting for this amazing sandwich was the best thing ever there was not one but two conversations about who had waited the longest in line at Ike's. there is nothing hipsters like more than to show how much they will ""suffer"" to get something. 1 1/2 hours won by the way. Then there was the disbelief that some of us had never eaten there before, with the combo of ""but it's been on Food Network and I've been coming here since before the pre-opening.""why is so much of the review not about the sandwiches? well that's because they are pretty forgettable.I got a sandwich with salami and corned beef and smoked gouda none of which are subtle flavours but I couldn't taste them at all. In part that was because the smoked gouda was sliced the thinnest I've ever seen cheese sliced, the meat portions were tiny and finally instead of there being french dressing on top of it, it was swimming in it in addition to a cup of mayo or aoli. to top it off the only change I made was no pickles. Yup, there were pickles on it. Also it state that the sandwiches are warm. Yeah not really, more like slightly heated meat and not enough to heat anything else.Also disturbing was the black folks in front of me were given their food after me and were asked to give their menu to other people even though they weren't done with it.

There they come around with large metal dishes and ladle out the curry, dal, rice and raita, here it's cafeteria style. So the food is bland, was lukewarm and just not very good. for 10 dollars I can go to any Indian place and get a dish that just plain taste better. Sure people will say but for 10 dollars you also get dal, salad and rice but the reality is that the dal was probably some of the worst I've tasted ever and that includes the dal at a this white folks guru cult restaurant in Prague a place really not known for Indian food.

I've gotten to try all their meat and found them to just not be that good.then you add the small portions and higher prices.I can only assume that people like the place because it's super clean and run by a white boy. Frankly I'll take some neighborhood joint like the BBQ places on Van Ness or in Soma that aren't all shiny and polished but has tender flavourful meats.

For the price of a 10 dollar box you can get a hot or cold freshly made meal at Sally's right next door or at any of a 1/2 dozen places around the area.Not sure why they call it a bento box as there is actually very little in the boxes. It may seem healthy but it actually wasn't. The quiche and granola with yogurt probably had more cholesterol and fat than many sandwiches. The Chinatown was a really white guy version of Japanese take out food which made the name all the more fail. Hint Soba noodles are not Chinese.I think this will popular with the marina and hipster workers who feel guilty about not making their own lunches and want to pretend that this is healthier and more like them making it themselves than going to a restaurant.

I know good food and I know good Mexican food but this place while being decent is far far from ""the best Mexican place in SF"" as a recent SF Chronicle reviewer called it.I went on a Friday with a group of seven. We had called ahead to get put on the waiting list. We order 12 dishes in all so I think we had a good chunk of menu and except for two meat dishes the general review was: meh. The portions were small for the price. The dishes while non-greasy and healthy tasting were bland and boring in flavour. The vegetarian dishes were judged to be flat out boring and bad. The two dishes we did like the most were the goat in mole and the pork shoulder. Would I go back here. Since the panhandle is not my neighborhood (and no I will not call it nopa) and since there are least a dozen mexican restuarants that are just as clean, attractive, affordable and have better tasting dishes I don't think we will ever go back.I think if you are a Marina frat boy or girl who is afraid of going to the mission or even hayes valley this would be a great place for you to go for your mexican food desires.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

Which this internet clothing site is based in Los Angeles they neither make their own clothing nor is it all made in Los Angeles or even in the USA. I tried to purchase items off their site but never got email returned about questions. Then when I did order something, they kept delaying sending it to me and I finally canceled the order.They are extremely unprofessional. They have used abusive and insulting language to customers and to people enquiring about the business.As for the clothing, some of it is decent but most of the stuff that is decent can be found for CHEAPER in other locations. Much of their stuff are design rip-offs and of poor quality especially the items they claim they do design which are mass producted outside the US.Do business with them at your own risk.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10776,"Horrible. While the menu looks great the food and the service are not. What we were served was in no way what was described on the menu.I order stuffed marscopone french toast with strawberries, what I got was two slices of french toast with one, yes one strawberry sliced on it and a small amount of whipped cream on top. I had to ask for the marscopone, then explain what it was. The same went for the dishes the two people I was eating with got. The prices aren't bad but you don't get what you ordered. We seemed to have three or many even four people serving us that's when they thought of it who never communicated with each other, it took forever to get menus, get the food and then get the bill.The food itself was very bland and it seemed like they had never heard of herbs or seasoning. The decor was way overdone and the space is filled with too much bric-a-brac.I don't plan to ever go back. It's the kind of place that people go to because it's in their neighborhood and they have gotten use to very average food in the Castro.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

It's the kind of food you can find in large hotels around the world. The chef has loads of technique for sure and will wow the clueless with dated tricks with liquid nitrogen. The bottom line is the flavours weren't that great and the food was very common.

I knew not expect anything too mind blowing from a place on the tourist stripe of North Beach but this was seriously the archtype of bland basic Italian for tourists place.Was the food edible, yes. was it tasty, not so much. was it interesting or worth going back to? not at all.Price wise it ranges from 12 to 20 which seems pretty good until you realize how average and boring the food is. I got the veal marsala (19 dollars) and it was four small piece that weren't that tender and frankly the whole point of veal is how tender it is. My wife got the ravoli porcini which was just ravoli in red cream sauce with a tiny amount of porcini mushrooms.(15).we had bruchetta to start with which was pretty plain and a chocolate cover canoli which was the best things we had.It was 60 dollar meal that tasted like a 20 dollar meal at the Olive Garden.

10791,"Horrible vegan food. I feel so bad for the people who go here to eat vegan food. I can only guess that they are under the assumption that vegan food should be bland, poorly cooked and make you sick or maybe they are rich young kids pretending to be anachists and are too lazy to learn how to cook vegan food but want to impress some girl so they come here.I really have no idea why anyone who actually like vegan food would come here. we went twice hoping that the guy cooking was just learning or maybe was having a bad day but nope the food was terrible. How can people mess up tofu scamble or biscuits? the biscuits were still doughy and full of salt and the tofu scramble well slimy and salty were best words for it. All the food was either uncooked or overcooked, the only seasonings they seemed to use were salt or some curry seasoning. I think it may have been the worst vegan food I've had in North America and I've eaten at least 75-100 vegan places in the US alone.Seriously vegan food can taste as good if not better than any non vegan food. There is no reason why anyone should ever have to eat the food that is made here and there is no reason why they should serve it. It is insanely easy to make good vegan food. After trying to eat breakfast here at least we were motivated to go home and make a real vegan feast.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g

Then we had to ask for menus as they seemed to forget we were there.Not to mention I was Penty pissed to pay over 10 dollars for food that belongs at Denny's and would of at least been served warm there.My tummy was plenty upset less than an hour later and there are plenty of reason I would be going back to Plenty.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10810,"Tonight we set out on a hunt for the rare elusive veggie meats. Nothing but a piece of gluten magically transformed in every kind of meatish product would do. Just to be clear though no amount of crafty cooking can make mock meat real and the best mock meat have the texture or slight taste of meat without being too meat. sounds odd but once you've had the good stuff even if you are a happy carnivore like me, you'll understand.Driving around International District we thought we had hit pay dirt seeing the name Vegetarian Bistro in the window. But it was not to be our nirvana.The place was dead, no one except us. I was totally excited for all veggie dim sum and we had three kinds, the shrimp buns, pan fried radish cakes and deep fried spring rolls. while the fried food was good the shrimp buns were cold and taste less.We also order a plate of the broccoli and ""beef"". The was super rubbery and we left most it. It was hard to judge the taste when you are chewing for so long. Alas our quest for the tasty mock meats continues.the food was very affordable (3 dollars for each dim sum) and most stuff under 10 dollars but if you can't eat it, it's not worth any money.Will I go back? no thanks?",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10811,"What a disappointment. After reading the reviews and looking at the tasting menu I was really looking forward to a white linen establishment and having a relaxed three hour meal.I made a reservation in advance but the only thing they said they had available was at 8:45 on a Friday for the dining room. Having heard about the view I request for a window seat.Well the first strike was when we got there at 8:45 as an other couple without a reservation arrived and was told our table wasn't ready since another party had stayed longer. We waited at the bar where it took a good ten minutes for the barman who told us to wait to stop empty the dishwasher and take our drink order.We finally got seated almost 20 minutes later and guess what, no window seat and in a dining room with only 20 tables four of them were empty and no one had left since we arrived.It was 9:15 before we even got our drinks and we had to ask for bread which the server dropped on the floor.We kept trying to have a good time and usually I try to just focus on the food but a big part of why we picked this place was because of the atmosphere and the style. I did love how quiet and intimate the space was and the wall of windows looking out over the pier and water. Maybe if the food had been exceptional it would have made the poor service less memorable. But the food while very nice was not special except for the dessert.The menu:we started with oysters with two vinagrettes, one was a mango one and one a garlic, they were lovely, raw and slid down our throats, the vinaigrette enhanced the oyster own fresh taste. What made the dish good was the quality of the oysters and not the vinagrettes.For the second course the wife had a salmon tar tare which was small and not that interesting with a short stack of flat bread alternating with salmon tar tare and salmon roe on top. My second course was great, seared Foie Gras, a smaller piece then I was expecting but seared to perfection. It was served on an apple tart which I know they put on it for the contrast of the flavors but the tart should have been more well tart than sweet and I ended up eating the separately. Again what made the dish so good was the Foie Gras and not the whole dish.For our entrees I had the duck confit that was far from the best I've had (the best in Seattle being at Crave). My sides of french beans and green were horrible. I literally couldn't eat them, the greens were tough and the beans weren't fully cooked. The wife had a chanterelle and chevre herbed crepe that was good but as she said not exceptional. For dessert the chocolate cake was like one big luscious truffle. It was really exceptional and if it was made in house, the pasty chef is a star.The total without drink or tip was 120.My wife had the idea that the lackluster service was based on her appearance since she has a Mohawk and  prefers hoodies and combat boots to dresses and she said that she has had bad service in the Northwest before based on her appearance. I had also checked to see if there was jacket requirement. I really hope that was not the case because we have had great service at 3 star Michelin restaurants where she was dressed as she usually does. A true white linen restaurant treats ever diner like they are a special guest.",D5uMny1pAVWhNGDvFDPp8g
10813,"I tried to eat here tonight but forgot to bring my id. For some insane reason even though they serve food, you have to 21 to eat here. Beside the fact that the wife and I are well past 30, it was all very surreal. The place looked cool, the attitude of the staff I could do without.NOTE To people who actually go to dinner to enjoy food. This a bar that serves some food. I'm guessing that most people just get drunk and then have the cheap grilled cheese so they don't pass out. edit went back and wish I hadn't. It was all the things I find silly about hipster places. Good concept, lousy and boring food. Come here to drink if you are too boring to do anything other than wear too tight jeans and drink cheesy drinks that aren't even made with top shelf liqueur although you still pay those prices. Maybe after a half a dozen drink the food would have been interesting. I can't believe I paid 14 dollars for a plate of penne pasta with a canned white sauce and tiny diced pieces of chicken that looked like they came out of a can too. I've had better food at a Friendly's or a Denny's and considering I loathe those place, that's not saying alot.While the concept of having each table closed off by curtains was very charming and could be very cool, the fact is that the people seem to forget that curtains don't bloke sound so we got to hear loudly about how robbing a bank is hard and this girl knew cause her uncle was in jail for it and then a conversation by the same folks about how puffy the sleeves on your sweater should be (puffy sleeves on sweater, WTF). Conversations I tried very hard to bloke our but since it was like someone was yelling it in my ear wasn't possible and they got up (drunk) girl nearly landed in my lap.

The pork was good, as was the soup, but I did not like the skin. The top part where it's bunched together had a raw dough/flour taste to it in my opinion. Also, I'm used to being provided with ginger in vinegar automatically, but here I had to ask for ginger. There was already vinegar at the table. Supreme steamed bun with Godiva chocolate and hazelnut $4.25 for 2 pieces: I've never tried a chocolate dumpling so I was curious. The chocolate filling was nice and warm, and there was only 1 hazelnut inside. The skin was the problem again as that doughy taste ruins it for me. Although the fillings were good, my personal dislike of the skin will keep me from returning. Also the price compared to serving size seemed too high in my opinion. But disclaimer, I don't remember how much Din Tai Fung or other places price it, so maybe it's comparable.",o8Lpbd9-X4Ep3z-gcVdNSw

You get to pick 2 sides from their list. We went with German potato salad and sauerkraut. I liked the potato salad because it was vinegary. I didn't like the sauerkraut here that much, can't put my finger on why. Potato Pancakes $10.95: These come as is, so no sides included. The outside was crispy, but I didn't really like the chewy texture in the middle.",o8Lpbd9-X4Ep3z-gcVdNSw

10866,"I recently became obsessed with crumpets. I first tried it at the Crumpet Shop, then bought a package from Trader Joe's, and now here. To be honest, all these crumpets tasted the same to me. It's the topping that makes the difference in my opinion. After this experience, I think just butter and jam is my preference. Blackberry Crumble $3.95: This did not scrimp on the toppings, which is good because I love a good crumble. Chicken and Crumpets $5.25: I felt like this one was overpriced considering the size of the chicken. It didn't really feel cohesive, so we ended up eating it separately. Beecher's Berries $4.25: I was surprised this one was on the savory menu. I didn't even taste any cheese! On paper I was most excited for this one, but was left disappointed. Soup of the day, small $3.95: It was tomato when I went, and it was pretty good. Royal Hot Chocolate, large $4.25: It tasted like standard hot chocolate to me. It wasn't that anything tasted bad here. I may have overhyped it in my head so it ended up being underwhelming. It's a cute place to come have 1-2 crumpets and a drink as a snack. But for a meal, the cost would add up quickly to be filling.",o8Lpbd9-X4Ep3z-gcVdNSw
10868,"The service was very friendly and the ambience was lovely. The quality of food just did not match the price in my opinion. Saganaki $14: I can never resist ordering flaming cheese. I've had it elsewhere where it was nice and ooey gooey before it hardened as it cooled, but there was no ooey gooey here even though I dug in right away. It wasn't served with pita bread either which I thought was odd, so I just used the complimentary bread that was set down earlier with oil and vinegar. I didn't ask about it either though, my life goal at that moment was to get the cheese in my mouth ASAP with whatever vessel within my current grasp. Moschari Souvlaki $32: The yogurt dressing was good and plentiful, however I wish the beef had been a lot more tender. The side of potatoes was also underwhelming. Nemea Special $10: This dessert was OK, but definitely not a stand out. Greek coffee $4: I don't have other Greek coffee experience to compare this to, just remember to stir well before drinking!* Edit: A helpful Yelper pointed out to me that you're actually supposed to only drink the top and leave the grounds settled at the bottom.

Instead, go inside the freezing Nijiya market next door first, and then your body will be begging for a hot bowl of ramen. Tonkatsu Ramen $10.50: The broth was more of the light variety, and I personally like thicker, fatter broths so it just didn't suit my taste. I'm also picky about my charsiu pork, and it was a bit too tough here for my liking. The service was very friendly, the place was clean, and prices were reasonable.

Unlike the menu offerings, all the champagne was the same versus a flight of different types. I was expecting tiny glasses but they don't skimp!Margarita on the Rocks $18: This was also 3 normal sized margaritas rather than smaller sizes I was expecting. I liked the passionfruit the most, followed by mango & jalapeño, and the classic was pretty standard, but I couldn't even finish it at that point. Falafel $15: I thought it'd be just falafel with different sauces, but it was 3 falafel pita sandwiches. I compare all falafel to Falafel's Drive in, and unfortunately this doesn't come close. The falafel was too dry in my opinion, and the sauces didn't wow me enough to make up for it. French Fries $11: I love French fries so this is great to share as a snack. Mac & Cheese $16: I was already pretty full by the time this came out. I was worried the portions would be small so I'd need carbs to fill up but that was not the case. This was OK. I feel like the idea of mac & cheese at a restaurant sounds good but I've never been blown away by one. Salads $15: It's nice to add some greens into the mix. I usually ask for extra dressing when I get salad but didn't need to here. BBQ sliders $15: I thought these were good, although I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the 3. The above food was shared between 3 people and we were too full to even ask if there was dessert.

Tortellini alla veneziana $18.95: I preferred this entree or the two we ordered, but it's not something I'd find myself craving again. Gnocchi al pesto $17.95: This was lackluster in flavor in my opinion. While we were waiting for our order to be taken, we could hear who seemed to the manager/owner giving a critique to one of the waiters. It felt pretty awkward to witness. Granted, the restaurant wasn't crowded at the time, but it seems that kind of talk should've taken place in the back, or at least in hushed voices.",o8Lpbd9-X4Ep3z-gcVdNSw

Soufflé for 2 $19.50: I chose raspberry, but it seemed to be a normal soufflé with a couple raspberries thrown in. Overall, while the food was fine, it didn't feel like good value for the price. If you do want to come just for bar bites, come during happy hour or don't bother.

Kitfo $17.90: This was on the dry side for me, and not very flavorful. Tibs wat $17.90: This was ok, but not memorable. We did finish everything because we were hungry, but I also felt portions were small. We did have to keep asking for more injera as you don't get much at a time.

The barista was able to get me a cup of grits without hassle. I thought there was too much biscuit compared to the topping ratio. But actually if I could have my way I'd just want grits topped with the gravy, cheese, and bacon.

Well, with a little bit of extra waiting time for the ice cream to thaw a bit to be usable. The churro discs (the only relevant CDs these days) are given to you separate from the ice cream for assembly. Rather than putting the sandwich together, I put spoonfuls of ice cream on the CD as I ate. This worked out and kept the ice cream from getting too meaty. Good for sharing between 2 people because each person gets their own CD. The CD wasn't quite as good as its regular stick form counterpart, but the contrast of warm churro and vanilla ice cream was nice. Next time, I'd rather grab a regular churro and ice cream flavor of choice at Haagen-Dazs to recreate this treat.",o8Lpbd9-X4Ep3z-gcVdNSw

11004,"Pretty random location for a ramen place. It's super small and there's no waiting area. So when all the tables are full you have no choice but to stand awkwardly by the door. There aren't that many tables for 4, and since they alternate the table sizes for 2 and 4 they don't have the option of pushing two tables together. My family ended up eating at two separate tables. But anyways on to the food. There are 4 broth choices: soy, salt, miso, and tonkatsu. The last two choices are $1 extra. I tried the soy with their signature ramen ($7.99). I like that it includes minced pork along with chashu. The bowl does look small when it comes out but they get a lot of noodles in there. The broth was very light but I didn't find it that flavorful. I compare all broths to Kahoo and this was just another place that didn't measure up. My mom tried the miso. The waitress warned her that it's a little bit sour but she tried it anyways. I just had one tiny sip and did not like it at all. And FYI, this place is cash only.",o8Lpbd9-X4Ep3z-gcVdNSw
11005,Meh. I've experienced better and at a lower price. The brisket was a HUGE disappointment. It was cut too thick. The bulgogi and ribs were ok. The place was still crowded despite robbing people blind for $30/person at dinner. And no sesame oil dipping sauce? Just plain wrong.,o8Lpbd9-X4Ep3z-gcVdNSw
11006,"I came here despite the bad reviews because the 3 course meal for $35 seemed like a good deal. I had my heart set on the grilled lamb chops parisienne, only to find out they no longer offer it as part of the Pre Fixe menu. But that's ok, beef brochette sounds good too. My friend was going to get the house made saucission, but they had run out. Chicken picatta it is.French Onion Soup - It was ok, not very memorable. Nowhere near cheesy enough.Beef Brochette - Very tender but flavorless. The mashed potatoes were good though.Chicken Picatta - Just say no. It's not terrible but it's definitely not worth the money. Though the side of tortelli was mighty tasty.Fruit Tart du Jour - The fruit du jour was apple. And a very sour apple at that. It was edible but you'd expect better dessert at a French place. It was served with one scoop of sorbet that was pretty amazing. I have no idea what flavor it was though. I want to guess raspberry.Overall, the food was mediocre at best. It's pretty sad that the highlight of the meal was the tortellini and sorbet. Our server was extremely friendly though. He overheard another table saying they were celebrating a birthday so he gave them free glasses of wine. So should you decide to try this place out, pretend it's your birthday.",o8Lpbd9-X4Ep3z-gcVdNSw
11008,"Monday-Friday 2-5PM mini one topping pizzas are $3. I don't know how much a mini pizza usually costs, but I felt ripped off paying $3 for it. It was super small, thin, and there was only 6 pepperonis on it. The crust has a nice crunch, but when there's no sauce it's extremely bland. The staff is friendly though and each booth has a TV. Even though it's not the best pizza, it's edible enough for me to come back on my lunch break.",o8Lpbd9-X4Ep3z-gcVdNSw
11009,"Service is quick, the food is just average. I liked that there was a short wait, especially for Sunday at noon. But that could just be because it was raining today. I got the corned beef hash and eggs. For about $8.79 you get the corned beef, two eggs, hash browns, and your choice of toast, pancakes, or Swedish crepes. I already knew from Yelp that they just use canned corned beef, but what can I say, I love the canned stuff. I was mainly here to try their Swedish crepes and left disappointed. I did like the berry butter they were served with, I just wasn't blown away.",o8Lpbd9-X4Ep3z-gcVdNSw
11013,"I guess since this place is outdoor seating, some people think it means seat yourself. No, you still need to put your name on the list and wait like the rest of us. We saw some people seat themselves only to be asked to get up and wait their turn. We went on a Friday around 6PM and there was live music. The wait for a table was one hour. The music was OK, it was just extremely loud. We had to wait for their breaks to have any conversations.Food is all $11 or under, but the portions are small. I had the carne asada torta ($10) which was pretty good and probably one of the more filling choices on the menu. It is criminal for a Mexican place to charge $3 for chips and salsa.  Specialty drinks range from $10-12 and they also have pitchers available. A glass of sangria is $6. If at least two people at your table are getting sangria, go ahead and get the pitcher for $18. One pitcher of sangria = 8 small glasses.",o8Lpbd9-X4Ep3z-gcVdNSw
11028,"This review is for the guava cake only. FYI, while on weekdays they let you call ahead and put a cake on hold, on weekends it's first come first serve. So either order, or get there earlier just in case. So my big issue is I don't think it tastes like guava. Now, I can't remember if I've ever actually had a real guava. But luckily we had a carton of Kern's Guava Nectar in the fridge so I used that for comparison. And no the cake tastes nothing like that. I was searching for even a hint of fruity flavor, but nothing. Just a plain ol' cake. I thought the frosting was too sweet, I couldn't even finish it. On the bright side, the cake is very light and fluffy. And it's super pretty!!But I probably won't bother getting it again.",o8Lpbd9-X4Ep3z-gcVdNSw
11034,"WORST SERVICE EVER!!It's not that the workers are lazy, they are just very confused and poorly managed. It took forever for the waiter to even take our order, and it took even longer for the food to come out. There was a table behind us who had ordered before we even came, but we got our food first. By the time they had decided to walk out, the cooks were begging them to stay as they frantically putting their food in to-go boxes. At least they didn't charge them for their food. Another table also walked out after being ignored for too long. Granted, it was a busy night, but never in my life have I seen such unorganized service.Now maybe it'd be ok if the food was worth the wait. It wasn't. We ordered the lamb pita, beef kabob, lamb kabob, and koobideh kabob. All of the meat was dry, not juicy at all. You'd expect a kabob place to have better kabobs. Greek fries are all right. Not good enough to make me ever want to come back.",o8Lpbd9-X4Ep3z-gcVdNSw
11035,"If you love your dog, NEVER take them here. We saw this place and thought we'd give it a try, so we brought our pomeranian here for a trim. When we came to pick her up, they had completely shaved off all her hair, which was NOT what we wanted. They said it was because she had a lot of knots, and was also difficult to handle because she kept biting them as they were brushing her. None of the previous grooming places ever had any trouble with her, and were able to take care of any knots without resorting to shaving everything off. The ""groomers"" were extremely rude and spoke to us in a condescending manner, and treated us like we didn't know how to take care of our dog. When we got home, we noticed that they had nicked our pom's butt when they shaved her. It bothered her for days and brought her energy level down. It seems like this place hires any idiot who has a razor and calls them a dog groomer.",o8Lpbd9-X4Ep3z-gcVdNSw
11054,"We discovered this place July 4th, 2016, when we just drove up and by chance were given one of the ground floor rooms.  These are rooms on the back of the hotel building that enjoy individual entries off the sidewalk.  They also give you a great view of the July 4th fireworks Hood River puts on.  The stay was a bit pricey, but we enjoyed it so much that we rebooked the same room for July 4th 2017.When July 4th 2017 came, we checked in and were told the room we had reserved had been rented to someone else, so we'd be put on the third floor.  We were not happy, but went up to the third floor and found we were in a room with linoleum floors which were wavy and a bathroom that was the size of a broom closet and dated probably from the time of Grover Cleveland. The bed was small and lumpy.  The sole window looked out on a view of an interior air shaft.  I complained to the manager, who miraculously found out the room we had originally reserved was somehow magically available after all.  We stayed there the night and in the morning reserved the same room for July 4th 2018.I checked with the hotel well before July 2018 to confirm the room reservation and was told that we had been upgraded to a ""studio suite"" on the third floor.  I insisted we wanted a ground floor room and after several calls back and forth was told we would be in the room we originally wanted.The night of July 3rd 2018, when we were packed and ready to go to Hood River on the 4th, the hotel called and advised me they were overbooked and  we would not be in the room we wanted but in one of their ""studio suites.""  I pointed out that we had a confirmation letter dated in July of 2017 confirming our reservation in one of the ground floor rooms.  No amount of argumentation got them to acknowledge our reservation.  They expressed regret that they would not be honoring our reservation and offered to try to rectify the matter but it was clear we would be in a third floor room or nothing.We will never stay in this Hotel again.  I encourage you to avoid it at all costs.I believe this hotel is practicing ""bait and switch.""  I doubt they even track their actual reservations.  The front desk staff are fine but the ownership and management are incompetents at best, liars and con artists at worst.",kxOraNqzwHwnkqgdpdV2xA
11060,"The place is clean, convenient to the freeway and the desk clerk was efficient and cordial.  I want to stress that the staff were all very good, efficient, cordial and as helpful as they could be.  The following items leading to the one star rating are all due to owner/manager policy decisions:The parking lot is poorly lit. That amounts to a security risk. The motel has been remodeled in the last few years and what were rooms with one king or queen bed now have two double beds crammed into them.  This means the beds each have one side flush up against a wall, with no room for a table on that side or any good way to get in bed on that side.  There was only one chair in the room we were given so only one guest at a time can sit comfortably. Third, if you bring a dog, you will be put into one of these rooms (no other choice is offered) and charged $15 extra for it. We stayed here often, with our dog, prior to the remodel and would have given the place 4 or 5 stars. There were rooms with one queen or king bed, an extra chair or two and they were quite comfortable. I am obliged to point out that La Quinta will offer any of their rooms to pet owners at no extra charge. Furthermore, there's a Best Western 14 miles north of here that gets excellent reviews and is pet friendly. We'll be driving a little farther when in this part of Oregon and staying elsewhere in the future.",kxOraNqzwHwnkqgdpdV2xA
11072,"Screw these people. You can't get the local address or phone number from Yelp or Google so you can't speak directly to the folks who would be doing the service. If this is their idea of responsiveness, I won't use them.",kxOraNqzwHwnkqgdpdV2xA
11103,"Had lunch here October 7th.  After reading other reviews, it's clear there has been a change in ownership since Guy Fiere was through.I can't say there was anything wrong with the food.  My wife had soup, I had a burger.  It just wasn't outstanding.  The service staff was very competent, which helped, but it can't compensate for mediocre food.Also, the men's room needed a lot of attention.  It was simply not up to snuff for a decent restaurant.  Wet toilet paper all over the floor, the sink was dirty, there was graffiti and the lighting was poor.  I went in after we ate.  We would have found another restaurant if I'd seen the men's room before ordering.",kxOraNqzwHwnkqgdpdV2xA

GENERAL AIRPORT/FLIGHT EXPERIENCE FEEDBACK & SUGGESTIONS: We did not experience any problems on any of the flights, but did experience several problems with the last short leg of our trip on United.In brief on 3:1. Pre-Flight ESA Documentation - As requested by United, we emailed all of our ESA documentation, and received an approval email back. PROBLEM: The email we received was addressed to a different person, not us, and aside from that type of Health Information being of a CONFIDENTIAL matter - It was not reassuring after all the recent publicity with the dead puppy on an Orlando flight similar to the one we were taking, and also made us very concerned about our own Health Information going to someone else's email. 2. Orlando MCO Airport Check-in: As told, we went to one of the united's airport service agent (There were about 5-7 agents/all wearing same uniform) to check-in and provide our ESA dog documents again:a. First agent told us that he could not help us, but to go the agent to his leftb. We then went in line again and went to the other agent, who then told us he could not help us and send us to another agent to his leftc.

11225,"On thursday night upon arriving in LA from NYC, I bought. 2 california rolls in brown rice and avocado. I was starving and had 1 right away. About 3 hours later, I became very nauseas, major headache and vomitted. Even the next morning I had a major headache.Today, I had to come back to get other items for an elderly relative and informed the person sitting in the managers booth. He was very cordial, white guy, dark brown/black beard, but did not take any notes on my experience. I gave him one of the packages that was still on the shelve and he put it to the side. I repeatedly asked him to make sure this is reported because the reaction was severe for me but could be much worst for an elderly person.I am a long time trader joes believer but found the lack of urgency or immediate interest in writing this report very disturbing.Keep in mind that I was not even asking for a refund on those 2 california rolls.They need to put in a better and more urgent process in place for situations like this at every store.",-Yb1srF4RYtpn-6Yp8ojRg

Members vs. Personal Trainer Space: ""Never on a Monday"" should be a motto to stand by at this gym because on Monday nights between the very high number of members and some personal trainers with their trainees asking you to jump in or move out of the machine you just finally were able to get to - it makes the workout experience far too stressful, lengthy & not productive.2.

11242,"If the GEEK Squad Repair Services is the future of Best Buy, Wall Street We have a Problem!What I thought would be a simple laptop keyboard replacement has turned to be a journey thru one of the worst customer service process ever experienced. The folks at the local Best Buys store were great, it was the folks the Geek Squad repair center that the machine was shipped to where the problems surface immediately:1. Shipment Tracking - Laptop go there 7/31, but their repair center (maybe using VA Center Scandal Tactics to not show long waitlist of customers) says they got it 8/4. So where was my laptop form 7/31 to 8/4? No one on their end knows.2. Get email telling me to call for estimate - Preliminary estimate had been about $130. After being placed on hold for what seemed like an eternity, I get a young man who takes my cell phone and other information and then tells me that he needs to pass me to the geek squad repair person with my laptop to go over estimate. 3. Then I get Shakira(?) who kept breaking up over the phone line and who then asked me for all the same information i had given the fellow before her. Then she asked me if I had the laptop with me (?). 4. After finally finding my laptop service request on the computer, she says it will be $240 which was over $100 above preliminary estimate, so I asked basic simple question - What is the repair for? Her answer: ""I don't know. You have to approve to move forward"" Bottomline, she was not provided with any type of details of what the repair was for - 0.5. Shakira then transferred me to Agent Brian in Geek Squad Customer Support out of Utah, who then informed me that ""He also did not have the specifics of what the $240 being requested was for"", but that he would get me a Supervisor to assist. Bottomline: I am still on hold with Brian and one thing is clear - If you, like many of us, buy your electronics at Best Buy because of the security of being able to use their Geek Squad when you need it - WARNING: Sad to say, it does not work.

Believe me, its a scam. They treat the employees like crap and tell them they cant leave the store on their lunches (unpaid). They get people and businesses to donate free items to make a profit. They dont contribute anything substantial into society.

My wait was much shorter and the other doctor was much more considerate and explained the issues less confusingly.

So basically he threw out our plan and told me that I can either take a lower dose medication and wait or go see someone else. He cant help me and is not going to go forward with my health plan choice. I have been waiting since March of 2016 and it is now October 2016. My eyes are protruding, I haven't gone out since maybe... May because people look at me strangely and I just want to be healthy again. Im glad that he took the time to explain the risks of my choice but his approach comes off as... I know better than you. In our session his minion said that she agreed with his decision but when we got in the lobby she told me otherwise. She didnt agree with me either but at least she wasnt going to give up on me because I didnt agree with her. Before he left he told me I need to schedule an appointment for a month out, with no labs.... WTF for???? So you can get my money? Naw homie. Ill go back if I can see another doctor.

Didn't wait long at all. Like 5minutes. I told the hostess that it was my friends birthday. We ordered our BlackBerry Cosmos, which were really good btw. The only reason they get one star. By 815 we both ordered the fillet. About 840 the waiter came and asked me if I got my salad. Told him I didn't order one but thanks. At 900 we had to call the waiter, Justin, over to tell him to bring my check and keep the food. He acknowledged that it had been over 40min and he would check on our food right away. I said no thanks. Then brought the check with the two fillets still on. Yeah. Not gonna happen. He took them off and appologized.... The manager never came to the table to say anything about not getting our food, as we walked out, with our empty stomachs, he said ""sorry ladies"". Fuck You. For ruining a birthday. Shoulda comped the drinks.",K_DZ_mUkIvgK4FCv6Hwygw
11417,"So. Let's begin. The outside is pretty sketchy and lemme tell ya, the inside matches the outside. Can't remember the unprofessional teenagers name that just did my nails but you could tell by her convo with the other staff that she is childish. The music was so loud they couldn't hear each other and they were eating at the stations. Ugh... The stations were so dirty as well as the floor. The nail and cuticle clippers were rusted so I told her not to bother with that part. Because of the other reviews I wanted to give the girl a chance. On to the gel mani....... Soooooo. She didn't even take off all of the previous gel, she just painted right over that sh*t! She applied the gel polish so thin that it seems like regular polish. There is all kinds of stuff in my gel like, lint and bubbles... The old gel she didn't feel like removing. Dang. AND it's lumpy. I'm really disappointed.

I don't even know what the meat is. The chicken was weird and really white with a strange mushy texture, I'm sure it's not actually chicken. The shrimp tasted like nothing at all and the pork was a gelatin texture. Wtf! The Walnut Shrimp was ok but needed more sauce.

She couldn't even gather two waters in a timely fashion. I asked her what shakes they had and she told me to go look at instagram. I've already liked them on the gram, so just f*ckin tell me. Guess if you don't have an IG then you don't get a shake. Lol That was really annoying because after I looked, it took her 15 min to come back to our table..... Without the water or root beer float we already ordered. On to the food.... I had an outlaw burger with the bbq sauce on the side. I couldn't even get my mouth around that sh!t. It was hella good but dizzam. The onion rings were pretty good. They have tartar sauce I know that seems weird but I'm from Seattle, mind Ur bizznezz. My mom had a party melt that she liked. It was pretty big too she could only eat half. My dad had a BLT, that was good too. So my shake came like 30min after I was done eating. To make up for it, she gave us a free basket of onion rings but the service damage was already done. Plus I noticed that she could only carry one thing at a time, one water, one box, one food order. Faaaack man. Smores shake was really good. They light the marshmallows on fire to toast em. Not sure if all be back because of the slow ass service. I wasn't gonna tip her but I'm not rude like that.

I mentioned that the people at my table were already done with their food and he said... your gonna have to bear with us, were busy and your food took a long time. I said ok well people that arrived after me were already gone and i dont think it takes 20min to trow together some meat and bread. This guy was a jerk and didnt want to admit to the mistake.

Only Bristol Farms and it was a little expensive. It was $15 for both of us to get in... free parking but dang. I had Salmon from a vendor but it was over seasoned... front and back.

But I'd like to add, have any of you all even BEEN to a restaurant? My friends last day in the area is this week, so I thought I'd treat her and my 4 year old to some sushi lunch. Since Mashiko doesnt open for lunch, I found this ""gem"" on Yelp. Hey, it has 4 stars, cant be that bad right?What in the WHAT?!?! ITS THAT BAD.To start. We waited in front for about 10 minutes (the restaurant was empty)  before someone finally came out to notice us. Mind you, again, we were with a 4 year old. They are loud and make their presence very much known. They knew we were there.We were told to grab a seat, we did....then we waited. And waited. 10 minutes went by and she came back from out of the back room and handed us menus. I went to ask her for juice for my son and water for us but before I could make a sound she scurried away. I wont go on about the expierence and just provide the readers digest version:Random new waitress halfway throughGreasy ass gyozaSoggy marsh like agadashi*side eye from new waitress randomly*THE chewiest salmon sashimi I've ever had*more random side eye from new young waitress*Scene finally - A roach next to my friend by the window we were sitting at.

She brought the change back and exclaimed that it was a bit over $4, clearly not pleased with what I was leaving.

The view *could* be nice, if it weren't for the windows being COVERED in spiders. Its beyond off-putting. Right when you take a bite of your over salted, obviously pre-plated food, you look over to see a land beast of a spider lurking at you from the widow. I saw over ten different huge spiders while sitting in my 1970's booth in just under an hour.The servers are nice, the Stella was cold, but the rest I could really just do without.

11564,"I feel horrible giving this review. I'm a pretty open person when it comes to mistakes, people, and businesses, and also a very forgiving person. But after reflecting for a week, this one star review is necessary. I purchased an amazon local deal. Even though I've been here in the past, I always look forward to these. I had a baby a year ago, so it's been awhile since I've had my hair done. I was REALLY excited to have a day away for myself, as my hair was a hot mess, and my husband finally agreed to pay for a sitter while I took care of me for once, but also let me plan a ""date day"" for us sans kiddo afterwards. Yay me! But then...I showed up about 10 minutes late, unbeknownst to me. The confirmation I received said 10am (I checked my email confirmation when I got home), but apparently my appointment on their end was at 9:30. When you call, you speak to a call center, not the actual salon. This is something I learned halfway in to my appointment  - and it's pertinent knowledge for this review and as to is why the time was off on both ends. I'm not going to name my hair stylist, because she was amazeballs. Funny, understanding, and eager to get at my long thick hair to do amazing things. Unfortunately, due to the call center not booking me properly, she was unable to do the above. Mostly. After 60 minutes and right after washing my hair, it was discovered there was not enough time to complete my booking and I was asked if I'd be okay leaving with wet hair, no cut, and asked to come back another day. A customer that had her hair butchered at the school was booked next, and so therefore she had no time to finish my service, even though I'd already paid. Also, all other stylists were booked so NO one was around to at least finish for her. Until...someone walked by 1 hour before his shift was to start, and she offered him $20 to blow dry my hair. She told him to clock-in early and help, and he did so. He was AMAZING btw, but at this point I felt bad for even being there. On MY day, I felt bad. He dried my hair and she went to work on her next client, but my hair wasn't cut, and it wasn't done. I'm a flexible person. And to be honest, I stated this to her. But, I was exited for my break from my baby and to come home with beautiful hair. I understand that you can't control if your company fu*ked up, but when I got home my husband was PISSED. He was mad I paid a sitter, he was mad I paid for parking, and he was mad I needed to do the same 2 weeks later (the follow-up appointment I made) and that I was told by the salon my return  ""would be free for the inconvenience."" Um. OF COURSE ITS FREE. YOU DIDNT DO ANYTHING. Out of guilt, I tipped the two stylists $20 a piece, but I never got my service. And I ended up with an upset partner, and sad me for not feeling sexy like I did prior to baby. The whole experience sucked. And it ruined the one date day I was supposed to have after over a year. I'm stuck with a crappy do, because I couldn't go back when it worked for them. Sad. Panda.",3kMjMzU5N20tTYg3p_o0bQ
11567,"I'm not gonna lie - I LOVE me some REI. Even though I know this place is a rip-off, and can get better deals from Amazon etc, they always have great customer service, and well, their credit card has great rewards, which encourages us to shop there - but only when we receive our dividends.My experience yesterday makes me want to cancel our credit card & membership with them. I don't think the rewards are worth it any more. Upon entering the store, we were welcomed by 4 people standing in front asking what we were looking for and where we could be directed. Thats great, but in stereo, it can be overwhelming. It was about 3 minutes of all 4 of them talking and telling us about specials, asking if we were members, before we were ""released"" to the store.Here's why I give 2 stars - I've been looking for hiking boots, rain boots, and 2 new jackets for my 1.5 year old son for awhile. We stopped by this location on our way to a camping trip that was suddenly going to be a rainy one, and figured we'd use our dividends and REI's expertise to outfit our child, and maybe even ourselves, if we felt the urge to splurge. No deal. I went straight to the shoe section with my son, because I figured it would be the most timely portion of our visit, and well, toddlers apparently aren't keen on shopping, so I try to spend our time wisely. I found a rain boot immediately that I liked *yay joy!* and a girl approached me and asked if I needed help. While holding a size 7 rain boot, I asked her what the smallest size they came in, she responded ""8."" with a blank stare. I felt like she had no desire to help, but just in case, since I've worked in retail and know oftentimes sizes on the floor don't reflect whats in stock, so I picked up my second choice ""do you know the smallest size this comes in?"" ""8."""" I was holding a 6. Now I'm mad. Please don't ask me if I need help, when you don't feel like doing anything nor helping me. Please. I have a toddler, I don't need another one. I then asked her what the smallest size in ANY shoe they carried, and of course....you guessed it....9. This girl seriously looked me in the eye, after saying ""8"" twice, and said the smallest size they carry was a 9. After I held a 6, and a 7.I know this sounds trivial, but honestly, I don't expect service like this from REI, and I CERTAINLY don't expect it from an over-priced store in the first place.",3kMjMzU5N20tTYg3p_o0bQ

I went from wet hair, to her blow drying my hair with her hands, to her curling my hair.  NOT ONCE DID SHE RUN A COMB OR BRUSH THROUGH MY HAIR AFTER WASHING IT---WEIRD! My hair is well passed my shoulders, so it's long enough that it needs to be combed after it's wet.-My requested ""loose waves"" look like ringlets that a child did, sadly.-My hair is frizzy. She didn't put any product on the spots that are frizzy to try and control the frizz.-Even though there wasn't anyone else in the salon while I was there, the blowout felt very rushed.Needless to say, I will not be back here and wouldn't recommend this place.  I ask for a pretty simply style for my blowout, and she couldn't even do that.",_gfCS6dV7I6x29b7K73ZKg

It has a good ambience with the Italian music, woodfire pizza oven, fountain, etc.I ordered the Penne Pasta e Broccoli with gluten-free pasta, and my husband had the Capone calzone. The flavor on my pasta was good but not for the price. First, there wasn't even any broccoli . Not sure how the word is in the name of the entree but yet it doesn't have any of the actual ingredient in it.

I asked for cheese and red pepper flakes to try to add some flavor to the sauce, but even that didn't give it much flavor. My husband also commented how bland the sauce was.

While I don't mind sharing with my mom it is the principle that they tried to save money by asking us to share tools to save money.  Sharing tools defeats the purpose of each client having a new set to avoid the spread of germs/warts/etc.While they offer decent deals/prices, I will not be returning.  They seem understaffed, rushed, and that quality isn't valued.",_gfCS6dV7I6x29b7K73ZKg

11728,"Ok its my own damn fault expecting the food to be great (to be fair I didn't expect it to be great just edible).  Got some pasta and it was terrible.  The most ""awesome"" (read: terrible) part of the whole thing.  Gentlemen in front of me in line was waiting for the check out person to ring up his food.  Check out guy was busy texting (or something).  Gentlemen in front of me ""Excuse me could you check me out?"" (said politely mind you..he should have said ""Excuse me *#$#& would you mind taking a moment to DO your F-ing job?).  Check out guy: ""Just a moment"" (said rudely and snootily). After he finally did get it together and DID HIS JOB the gentleman in front of me left.  Check out guy needed to have the last word?!?! Or something so decided to yell ""Nice Matrix outfit!"" (yes he was wearing black) looking expectantly..for what?  a high 5 or something?!?!  Instead I stared blankly, checked out as quickly as possible and left vowing never to return.",91ECzjsMpfl7-40m7AcDFw

11734,"Well, Cascadia, the good news is you have good service.  Our waitress was quick to take away our plates of mostly untouched food.  That's a good thing isn't it?  The other day Gamz and I found ourselves enjoying one of the last days of sunny Seattle weather while eating outdoors at Cascadia.  The breezy ""summer"" air and the people watching was top notch.  On such an occasion food should be the cream on top of a good day.  In this instance the cream had gone bad days before...Heirloom tomatoes salad? Lacking flavor and boooooring... The fish that followed was...dare I say it...fishy.  Not good.  There are plenty of other spots in Belltown to dine, I'll be back soon...to go to one of them.",91ECzjsMpfl7-40m7AcDFw

11745,"No free refills.  The napkins are stored behind the counter so you can't get them yourself, they will bring them to you when they bring you your food.  These are not the reasons I'm rating this low (although they are part of it).  The food is not that great.

11746,Meh.  Anytime you order duck I feel very strongly that it should be an experience.  The duck here was good but it wasn't what I'd call an experience.  Overall everything was fine but I wouldn't find myself recommending this place to a close friend.  An acquaintance maybe but not a close friend.,91ECzjsMpfl7-40m7AcDFw
11753,"The price was ok and the location is good.  Room was clean but missing the deadbolt (fine I guess but made me slightly paranoid about leaving my laptop in my room...so I didn't).  You are provided an in room safe and wi-fi internet for only an additional charge of $8! Wow awesome.  I love it when I'm given things I didn't ask for and charged for them regardless, I especially like it when the wi-fi doesn't work.  The upside is the staff was very friendly.  Especially the lady that checked me in, felt like I was checking into her house (in a good way).",91ECzjsMpfl7-40m7AcDFw

11768,"I wanted to like the Patio, I really did (I hate when reviews start this way, I really do).  I guess I have a problem when restaurants don't seem to have a clear idea of what they are.  The Patio seems to have this problem.  'Hey look we're a diner.' 'Oh...wait I mean we serve fancy food!'I guess this is kind of the cool thing to do.  Be a diner but have 'hip' food, whatever that means.  Honestly I don't care what you are trying to be, I just want to have delicious food.  Here I did not.  Dad had a smoked salmon pizza, which was basically cream cheese, smoked salmon and caperson a hard cracker?  I had a BLAT which was very unexciting as well.  I pretty much love anything with bacon but I didn't love this.  The service also was very poor, read...slow.  The place is new maybe so maybe they're still finding their mojo. But hey, first impressions are everything.",91ECzjsMpfl7-40m7AcDFw

The bartender was excellent and if I was reviewing just the bar and the service there this would be an easy 5.  He informed us that we best order soon to take advantage of happy hour.  Kudos.  Then we sit (not outside as we are impatient people).  The dinner was....not good.  Neil got a pasta that had such an overpowering capers flavor each bite tasted like...well a spoon full of capers.  I had fish that had so many flavors going on, my mouth was confused for hours afterwards.  Gamz's salad was the best tasting thing there.  The highlight of the evening were smores at our table.  This ALMOST made up for everything else..then I got the bill.In summary, the beginning and the ending (other than the bill) was pretty good its just the middle that f%$@ed it all up.",91ECzjsMpfl7-40m7AcDFw
11777,"I kinda wanted to give a higher rating because I think the field and surrounding facilities are very nice.  Everything was surprisingly clean and well nice (maybe because it's all so new).  BUT why is it so F%#%# hard to find your seats in this place?  All the signs that are meant to direct us sucked and made no sense and we spent a good 30 minutes wandering before finding our place. And YES we did ask for directions but we were given poor ones.  I know we weren't alone as we saw lots of other people wandering around aimlessly.  Anyways the place isn't bad just make sure to get some directions ahead of time online.  Find out where your seat is print out a map and bring it with you.

After this meal my socks were still solidly on my feet.  I ordered the steak and lobster.  The steak was fine but as I said not amazing.  Now lobster is even more important.  Lobster is pricey, and I understand and accept that.  It's expensive because every bite you take is like an orgasm in your mouth, or should be.  The lobster here was overcooked and on the chewy side.  In retrospect I should have sent it back, but I have a rule.

I didn't care for this place at all.  Now if you tend to like touristy places, IE shops and restaurants that cater to out of towners this might be the place for you.  Personally I always hope to use yelp to steer me away from such places. As some other reviewers mentioned Might be worth visiting to grab a few drinks up top and check out the view (might capitalized intentionally).  But after about 2 minutes I knew this was not a place I wanted to spend anytime.",91ECzjsMpfl7-40m7AcDFw
11812,HFS!! x 2 (holy fucking shit) this was disgusting and offensive on every level imaginable.  I don't know what I just ingested but I'm afraid to find out what it is going to do to me.  (Starbucks baristas were kind enough to give me a normal mocha after they witnessed the horror on my face after taking a sip of this filth.),91ECzjsMpfl7-40m7AcDFw
11817,I hate it when you visit a new city and all the hotel concierges and taxi drivers and pretty much everyone decide to send you to a rather expensive generic place.  NOW I'm being a little unfair here.  It wasn't that bad.  The food was fine but nothing special but it was ok.  Not all that memorable as I ate there only a few days ago and dont remember what I got.  Oh the mojito was really good.  But how hard are those?,91ECzjsMpfl7-40m7AcDFw
11821,When you walk into this Sears it is like walking directly into the 1970s....true the products are up to date and all that but something about the atmosphere here freaks me out.  When I first visited this store some months ago we were looking for a washer and dryer.  The sales man or sales associate or sales rep or whatever you are suppose to call them...stopped evolving (fashion wise) in 1973.  He was actually a caricature of a sales person.  Almost worth visiting to chat with this fine gentleman.  In the end he was helpful (although we did not purchase here).  Second and most recent trip was looking for a treadmill.  Stood around and searched for help for a good 15 minutes.  Finally found it and took another 20 minutes just to purchase. The computers are too old for anyone alive today to understand how they work.  At any rate if you can avoid going here...please do.  If you need to purchase from Sears do it online.,91ECzjsMpfl7-40m7AcDFw
11822,Yes it is close to the beach..yes it is very convenient. But these guys are asses.  It maybe be carry over from the 'badassness' of living in Westport and being a local surfer but when a friend of mine rented a boogie board here they were treated like shit.  The rental guy basically mocked him for renting a board.  Wow..dick.,91ECzjsMpfl7-40m7AcDFw
11826,"It is not a good sign when the bread is by far the highlight of the meal.  Palermo has the honor of serving easily the worst italian food I've ever had in a restaurant.  The pasta was far from al dente...overcooked and near mush.  Must have been cooked earlier this afternoon or perhaps yesterday?!?!  I paid an extra $2.50 for my pasta to come with meatballs, which as it turned out were far from edible.  Dry and...well.... basically gross.  Finally the atmosphere was far from ideal, should I be listening to Pink in an italian restaurant?  Overall nothing was good.  Even the bread, as I mentioned the highlight of the meal, was really nothing special.  Do yourself a favor..stay away...far far away.",91ECzjsMpfl7-40m7AcDFw

11835,Worst Italian...(is this italian food?!?) ever.  Wow I have sadly been here 3 times too many (I've been here three times).  Every time the food was awful.  Two out of the three times most of our party got upset stomachs out of the whole affair.  I suppose the whole draw of the place is the 'fun and lively' atmosphere..but for God's sake man back that up with some half way decent food.  (if you do end up going here please please please do yourself a favor and stay away from the clam linguini),91ECzjsMpfl7-40m7AcDFw

11869,Wow after reading all the reviews I feel I maybe need to go back and give this place another shot.  Sushi on a track passing your table...brilliant.  Sushi overloaded with mayo...gross.  Cheap yes but to be honest when you are looking for sushi cheap should come far down the list of important things.  None of the sushi felt fresh and all the rolls were so loaded with mayo I couldnt tell where the mayo ended and the fish began.  sushiland i'll pass for now.,91ECzjsMpfl7-40m7AcDFw
11873,to be honest I think I'm being kind with two stars here.  my friend the chef was visiting from out of town and was anxious to show us some 'good' food.  He had heard things so was taking us to dandelion.It is generous to say the food was underwhelming.  The food was tasteless overpriced and the service was indifferent.  I'm not saying this having tried only one meal either I tried my dish as well as two others and all were incredibly...untasty.  save your money and go somewhere else..anywhere else.,91ECzjsMpfl7-40m7AcDFw
11879,I do not like this dog park at all.  THE GOOD - uh ... it is a fenced area where your dog can run free?!THE BAD - Small filled with woodchips gets disgustingly muddy when it rains.  Smells (yeah I know it is a dog park and dog parks smell but this place...gross).  and i have encountered more than my fair share of unfriendly dogs at this place with owners who seem a little too nonchalant for my taste.  Too crowded on nice days and no where to walk.  So if you want to sit and just stare at your dog while it tries to entertain itself I guess this is the place if you want to walk with your dog off leash go somewhere else.,91ECzjsMpfl7-40m7AcDFw
11883,"boo boo anthony's.  after reading all the raves I'm starting to feel I maybe should give anthony's another chance but when i comes to food i rarely give second chances...especially when that first chance was aweful.  went there last year to get the fabled copper river salmon (if you haven't had, get some when the getting is good..but not here) the salmon was overcooked the atmosphere was horrible and the service was slow.  To top it all off the place is not on the inexpensive side...dont get me wrong I dont mind paying for good food but i abhor paying a lot of money for bad food. skip anthonys go to the Oceanaire instead.",91ECzjsMpfl7-40m7AcDFw
11906,"I used this shop once for some repairs when I lived closer - I actually chose it partly due to the number of great reviews on here.My own experience? It was a mixed bag. They did do a good job on the repair that was needed, and it was done fairly quickly. However, the job ended up costing me about 50+% over the original estimate I was given over the phone (Not a major repair, but it still meant paying about $125 more than expected). Granted, sometimes shops can run into unexpected issues, but I wasn't even given a phone call to be notified it would cost more (a standard practice for most automotive shops) - and that's what kind of soured the experience here for me here. Still giving 2 stars for good repair work, but if your experience is like mine, watch out for an unpleasant surprise when you get the bill. Better estimating/pricing transparency would go a long way here!",r1iDMzd3dG5q-R-jQRJZCw
11926,"Disclaimer: This review strictly based on food delivered - not the service/location!This place has plenty of potential, but this first try left me a bit underwhelmed, unfortunately. The Bahn mi is quite a beast of a sandwich portion-wise for the price, but wasn't really like a typical bahn mi - if you're looking for that wonderful combination of crunchy, light bread, and glorious char marks on the meat, with all ingredients proportionate, this just isn't it. There's also a lot of sauce for a bahn mi, which overpowered some of the flavors (of course, this is all subjective, but I feel a little goes a long way here!).Hopefully they're still just working out some kinks, but for now, it's tough for me to give a recommendation with lots of amazing Vietnamese options throughout town.",r1iDMzd3dG5q-R-jQRJZCw
12004,"Finally got around to trying this spot! My overall experience with it goes a little like this...Service - Good overall. Fast, and friendly enough. No issues here.Food - Hit and miss for me. Salad and rice were good. Meat tasted as though it may have been microwaved, versus off a grill. And let's be honest, I love just a hint of char w/my teriyaki, so I was a bit underwhelmed here. Pricing/portions aren't skimpy, nor generous - they're in the realm of ""fair"".Overall, this place will do the job if you're in lower Queen Anne, and in a pinch for some teriyaki (There aren't many options in the neighborhood), but with plenty of great Teriyaki spots all over the city, it isn't something I'd go too far out of my way for.",r1iDMzd3dG5q-R-jQRJZCw
12017,"Finally, after quite some time, I got a chance to try Red Mill! Much to my dismay however, I have quite mixed feelings on it.Let me start off with this - I honestly didn't think the burger was anything too spectacular. Don't get me wrong, it's still good - But far from the ""best burger in Seattle"" hype that seems to surround this place. The bulk of the ingredients are good, but the patty itself leaves more to be desired, considering the hype around this place/slightly steep prices for what you get.There is a redeeming factor to this place though - The onion rings! Oh my are they good. It's unfortunate that you can only pair them w/an ok burger though.My verdict? I'm not sure what the fuss is all about. There's a lot of other, better burger options in town.",r1iDMzd3dG5q-R-jQRJZCw
12024,"I really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately, it just didn't do it for me. Perhaps I caught them on an off-day, but this was my overall experience..Service - A bit cold. Not necessarily bad, per say, but a bit of friendliness goes a long way people! At least the drink came out fairly quickly.The Coffee itself - Something was really missing here. It seemed lacking in fullness and flavor, sadly. It was a bit spendier than average as well - Not a big issue if the quality is there, but I'm a little disappointed with that aspect of it.Maybe I'll give them another shot in the future, because I love supporting small, local businesses, but given the many great coffee options in this city, it might be awhile.",r1iDMzd3dG5q-R-jQRJZCw
12044,"Well, there's a first for everything, so they say. And here is a Yelp first for me - the dreaded one-star review!Hands down the worst experience I've ever had with a business. Please tell me, what's with the obsolete (years ago, I might add) business practice of only accepting a credit card (No debit, no cash, no check, no debit ran as credit, NOTHING else allowed) to place a deposit/secure a rental transaction, when most other rental services are happy to accept other forms of payment? Any good reason? because I'm having trouble thinking of even one. What's next? Paypal only?The end result - No rental car, and a most grandeur waste of precious time. I hate to slam a business, but these guys have earned it. There's a wiser way to spend your time and money - elsewhere.",r1iDMzd3dG5q-R-jQRJZCw
12066,"Finally got to try this place out after months of wanting to try it out. Hate to say it, but as somewhat of an avid doughnut connoisseur, I was let down.Before I go any further, I will say that good customer service was definitely there, so I can't fault LD at all there. It's the doughnuts themselves that just didn't wow me so much. I was a bit excited, with the whole quirky-topping combos they have going on here, ala Voodoo-Doughnut style, but the end result I had was a step above supermarket level. Not awful, just not worth the gourmet-level price tags found here.Perhaps I'll pay a revisit in the future, because I liked the service and the concept - It's just the cost-to-quality ratio that's off.",r1iDMzd3dG5q-R-jQRJZCw
12075,"Maybe I'm starting to overuse this phrase, but this is yet another situation where I'd like to give half stars, and award this a 2.5 overall.There's nothing necessarily ""bad"" about this place, so much as it's just not all that great IMO. On the rare occasions that I've been here, I've never had any bad service, and the prices are right. It's just that the food has a lot of tough competition here, with the abundance of great, local Asian food spots in the PNW. This is more what I'd call a ""fast food-ified"" version of American-Chinese food. It's certainly serviceable, but I just can't recommend it over the local Asian food options, or even some food court/deli dept. stuff I've had.",r1iDMzd3dG5q-R-jQRJZCw
12093,"Finally decided to give this place a try after driving by it countless times.Tried the pulled pork sandwich w/coleslaw and potato salad. Meat was pretty good, and the toasted bread was a nice touch, but I personally wasn't a big fan of the sauce (it's tomato-y as some other reviewers have said, as opposed to sweet and smokey). The potato salad and coleslaw were ok. Portions are pretty big for the money, but more sauce options would have automatically made this a 3 or 4 star review for me.Staff was nice, so I might revisit this joint sometime to try the French dip and dragon wheels. Overall, it's just the sauce that wasn't doing it for me.",r1iDMzd3dG5q-R-jQRJZCw
12117,"Oh Pho Tai', what has happened?The Pho here is so-so, but the Teriyaki and Panang curry are very good, and that's the only thing keeping me from giving this place one star. This place used to be fantastic. I was always a fan because of the aforementioned food being good, and the fact they were open late, and modestly priced to boot. Sadly, the customer service has gone to hell. Orders seem to take considerably longer to bring out than before, and on top of that, I tried to call in an order for food about 30-35 min before closing time. They told me that they weren't taking any more phone orders, and to come in to order as long as I could get there before closing. 10 min later, I arrive, only to be turned away, being told I couldn't order what I wanted!I'm not sure how the other locations fare, but until this one gets some new management/staff, I won't be coming back to it.Overall: B+ on the food, but a big fat F on service!",r1iDMzd3dG5q-R-jQRJZCw
12122,"The food was very good, but the service (outside of our server) was terrible.  The hostess was very un-friendly and cold.  She seemed to scowl when we asked her about the wait time and if we needed to put our names in.  She didn't take our names and instead said ""you're the only people waiting.""  Then 3 more couples showed up...Our food came after at least 2 of the tables seated before us, and it came in a very delayed way.  2 at our table got their orders, then about 10 minutes later the other two got part of their order.  We had to ask twice for a salad that was ordered.Every time our waitress came by she was very apologetic and attentive, but she wasn't the one delivering the food.  Some random guy delivered the food each time.Lastly, it seemed like someone might have flaked out on their shift, I wasn't quite sure what the drama was, but half the wait staff was huddled around having a good ol fashioned bitch sesh about 6 feet from our table...I mean at least go inside the restaurant away from the guests that you've seated all outside and near where you're airing your grievances.I honestly wouldn't go back, even though the food was delicious.",dcr2jXJhG05_4f8ngJ1RCQ
12131,"I was really disappointed to be honest.  After reading all of the favorable reviews, I was excited when my girlfriend and I had a chance to stop by and have a couple bites and a drink.From the outside it looked nice, but once we got inside, the lighting kind of threw off the whole feel of the interior.  I guess I expected it to be a little darker and more intimate instead, pretty darn bright for 11pm on a Saturday night.  The other thing that struck me as we walked in was that the whole place still smelled like a fresh paint job.  Not in that ""ooh, sweet, it's clean"" way.  More that ""god damn, it smells like oil paint.""We walked through to the non-bar side and were greeted by a very attentive waitress.  She was top notch, really friendly, quick and helpful.  She brought us out an order of the Beecher's Mac n Cheese, the Deviled Duckies (deviled duck eggs) and I had a sidecar.The sidecar was decent, but the sugar rim tasted like they used straight vanilla to hold the sugar to the rim, which totally overpowered the drink.The Deviled Duckies (which every time I spell the name doesn't seem right), were just off.  The yolk in the eggs was painful.  It was so over flavored (with more than just horseradish) that it came off as a hot and incomprehensible assault.  Pair that with the stiffer texture of the duck egg itself and it was wholly unpleasant.  I ate 1 egg and picked apart the others to try and figure out what the hell was going on with the things.The Beecher's Mac and Cheese was decent.  I'll admit this is probably totally something that has to do with my own personal tastes, but the sauce/rue was really runny and tasted a bit peppery, more like a chowder base than a mac n cheese.  My girlfriend really liked the mac...but gagged on the egg...so take that for what it's worth.I might come in again to try other drinks, but really I'd rather spend my money elsewhere.",dcr2jXJhG05_4f8ngJ1RCQ
12132,"I was really disappointed in my experience here.  My girlfriend and I got in to the theater a little bit early, but not tremendously.  We went in, got our seats and started looking over the menu.  Our server walked by and didn't acknowledge to see if we needed drinks or anything.10 minutes later or so, the movie started and we could hear the next theater loud and clear.  Awesome.15 minutes in, multiple servers walk by and I try to get their attention.  The 1st server said she wasn't our server so she couldn't take our order but she'd send someone in.  2nd server walks down our side of the aisle so I figure maybe that's him...no....instead ""I can't take your order, only your server can.""  Now we're 20 minutes in to the movie without having had a chance to order, awesome.Finally our server comes, doesn't say a word, takes our order and about 10 minutes later returns with the most sub par pizza I've ever had.  Strangely our beers also took 5 minutes longer than the pizza to come.So...at this point we arrived about 10 minutes before the movie, were served crap food and late beer halfway through the movie AND got to hear our neighbor's movie.I could have stayed home and had better delivery with a quieter experience and only been bothered by my own laziness for free.Not going back to Cinebarre.",dcr2jXJhG05_4f8ngJ1RCQ
12134,"Unfortunately overpriced for what you get.  The steak I ordered came out lukewarm, at least it was cooked medium rare...The quality of meat was so/so, the side veggies were covered in oil, not something I'd pay in the $30 range for.I'm not going back.",dcr2jXJhG05_4f8ngJ1RCQ
12143,"Really not worth the time to go.  I went up for lunch today thinking some sushi, miso and tea would do me good.  I got there and read over the menu a bit, but had read glowing reviews about the Bento boxes, so I thought I'd try one.   I ordered Bento Box B, but substituted the Albacore Roll it comes with with a spicy tuna roll.The spicy tuna was not spicy at all, though that could be partly due to the unusual pairing with avocado, which ended up making the whole thing taste confused, the flavor of avocado and tuna completely killed any other flavor.  The salmon nigiri was terrible quality salmon, it was stringy, had a odd consistency to it, it was definitely fairly low quality.The miso soup was decent, though a little on the salty side.  The chicken katsu was ok, but really, chicken katsu is hard to screw up, it's mostly in the sauce.Overall I wouldn't go back, it was definitely cheap, but not a deal.  The salmon had me a little worried.",dcr2jXJhG05_4f8ngJ1RCQ

12243,"My family used to own a (Chinese) restaurant a long time ago, so I know the hard work and stress it takes to keep a restaurant running, but I can honestly say that eating at Floata Seafood Restaurant in Vancouver was one of my worst experiences with dim sum...and I love dim sum! :( I try to not give places a (1) star rating because I always give them the benefit of the doubt, but Floata definitely deserves a (1) star rating in my opinion.It's touted to be the biggest dim sum place and a must see if you're in Chinatown, Vancouver (even listed as a highlight in the general Chinatown tourist brochures), but I regretted coming here immediately after the experience. Especially because I wanted my group to enjoy dim sum for our day trip to Vancouver and they didn't.The dim sum was average tasting at best, but the customer service was really terrible.  I don't expect much when with customer service but common decency and respect is all that every paying customer should get.  Here are a couple of things people should know about Floata Seafood Restaurant before they think about coming here:--Food Quality:  Overall, the food was average tasting and there was a bit too salty and greasy within everything we had.  Sure, some of the portion sizes are pretty big compared to other dim sum places but overall not worth it.  The quality also wasn't that great in my opinion.  The shrimp dumplings were overcooked and not made well at all because the wrapper immediately felt apart in pieces and was mushy when you tried to pick it up with your chopsticks.  The shrimp they used didn't seem very fresh and it was this grayish/pale orange, unappetizing color.  A good dumpling doesn't do and look like that.  The pork shui mai didn't taste half bad but not worth the $6.50 (CAD) for 4 pieces.  --Automatic 10% Gratuity Tip & Expensive:  They automatically put a 10% tip/gratuity on the bill with no warning, which means that they can be rude all they want and they don't have to be friendly to you at all as a paying customer.  Also, if you're going to get dim sum here, don't be surprised if you walk away feeling hungry with hurt pockets.  Regular dim sum dishes range from about $6.50 Canadian dollars, while in Seattle (from where I'm from), it's cheaper without the attitude. For the entire bill, I paid approximately $85-$90 (CAD) but everyone they left unsatisfied overall.--Rude & Disrespectful Waiters, Bad Customer Service & Long Wait times for Food:After asking a waiter if I could please have soy sauce for our table, he stared at me with an annoyed expression and frown like I was bothering him, and ignored me.  When I asked again, he turned his back right in front of me and went on doing what he was doing.  I even asked him in Chinese and he just muttered something without even helping. What's funny is that (5) mins later he was goofing around and laughing with a coworker and I still didn't get any soy sauce for the table. I then had to flag down a completely different waiter, and after repeatedly saying excuse me, this other waiter finally responded (because I was persistent in getting condiments for the table).  When soy sauce and chili sauce finally came out, it was in two small dipping containers for the whole table.   Another incident came when a person from my table asked a waiter in Chinese: Excuse me, sir, do you know how long the wait will be for our food?Which, by the way, we ordered 25 mins ago and felt it was a valid question to ask.  The waiter then starred at us and then rudely walked away without responding. At least have the common courtesy of giving us some kind of response to a valid question that was asked nicely.  Even if the answer is to say I don't know /it's on the way, they didn't need to be rude.As you can probably tell by this review, I do not recommend going to Floata Seafood Restaurant if you can help it.  If you are in Vancouver, try going to another dim sum place where the people have common courtesy (and deserve your business). Or, better yet, feel free to swing by Seattle's Chinatown, too.  Though Seattle's is smaller, I would have much preferred an outing at one of the okay dim sum places there than at Floata's any day in my book.",6XwhYkbgsPZNQLLvTWIc3Q
12301,"I've been to this Les Schwab twice before. My first experience several years ago was really good. The customer service was great, the employees were helpful, and the brake check didn't take long.However, my 2nd visit for a tire check was slightly different.  This may have been an off-day (Who knows).  Unfortunately, tire checks at Les Schwab are first come first serve and there's no way to schedule it beforehand. I came in on a weekday, thinking it would be less busy.  Boy was I wrong! The front desk person vaguely told me it might be a couple of hours, which I thought it would be (2) hours top.  I actually ended up waiting (4) hours total.  No one said anything to me during my wait time, and I received no ""sorry it took so long"" acknowledgment when I was called up.In the end, one of my tires needed to be replaced.  The person quoted me the lowest price as $180/tire.  I decided to wait before replacing the tire in order to compare all options.  However, the guy that gave me my quote didn't seem to care too much and didn't offer a lot of info.I also didn't get a copy of my quote, and when I asked another person for it, it was no where to be found. I guess if you're not doing any major work on your car, it's not that important. I mean, I get it to a certain degree, but I didn't feel important as a customer, which is kind of sad since my 1st experience was pleasant.On the plus side though, their waiting area is pretty convenient for customers.  This Les Schwab location has a free phone/device charging area, complimentary popcorn, and coffee and tea for customers.",6XwhYkbgsPZNQLLvTWIc3Q
12314,"Honestly, if I could give this Apfelwein Wagner no stars, I would.  This place is not friendly to tourists.  I hate to write negative reviews, but if it helps anyone visiting Frankfurt to avoid a bad dining experience, I'm all for it. The service was horrible and the waiters were extremely rude.  Unfortunately, it's not worth it to try Frankfurt's apple wine if this is the service that accompanies it.  Besides the fact that the apple wine in general wasn't particularly good, this place is chaotic and the staff were extremely unfriendly. My friend and I heard that this place might be good to taste apple wine for dinner.  It was a busier night, however, when we came into the restaurant, no waiters acknowledged us.  We saw plenty of them, but they were so unorganized.  I politely asked a question to several waiters (should I put my name down on a waitlist or is it first come/first serve?), but all I got back was rude, blank stares and them ignoring us like they didn't have the time of day.The wait staff made me feel like I was bothering them, and one older male waiter even yelled at me for asking for more clarification.  One of the younger waiters tried to apologize (with a look) for the older waiter's aggressive behavior, but by that time, my night was ruined.  Who wants to dine at a place where you feel like a second class citizen? I certainly don't.It's sad overall, because I was so excited to try this place out after reading some reviews. This restaurant, if you can call it that, single handedly put me in a bad mood for the rest of the night.  I recommend spending your time and money elsewhere.",6XwhYkbgsPZNQLLvTWIc3Q
12338,"How can I not be happy in paradise you say? Well, apparently you CAN have a bad experience in Mexico!  Luckily, my overall trip to Cancun was fun (due to friends and the tequila), but not because of Nyx Hotel itself.Located in the Hotel Zone in Cancun, it definitely had a convenient location.  However, that's about all that it has going for it.  --Standard Room:  Unfortunately, pics from their website are very deceiving.  The room was off to the side of the hotel, wi-fi connection was bad, no elevators, the room decor was worn down and out-dated.  --Sewage smell /Leaking water issue in our original room, which caused our key not to work.  Luckily, we were able to upgrade to a better room in the main hotel area, but mainly because my friend was persistant. The staff gave us hassle about changing rooms, like it was our fault.  We had to remind them several times we weren't to blame, the key didn't work, and that they shouldn't be charging us extra for the upgrade.--After several days staying the room, I started developing so many rashes on my entire left arm.  At first I thought it was maybe mosquito bites, but there were too many and they weren't even itchy.  I highly suspect that it could have been beg bugs, per a friend who had bed bugs before elsewhere.  No bueno! :(--Stolen Property/security issues:  While at the pool, I accidentally left my Dior prescription sunglasses on a towel by accident.  It was a splurge purchase from a while ago, and I rarely ever buy anything expensive.  When I went back to look for my glasses, the staff was somewhat rude about it.  I know it's my fault for forgetting my own property at the pool, but it was more about how the hotel staff reacted that made me upset.  They didn't care and the security guard even said he saw my glasses, but made no efforts to help and was dismissive.Overall, I was disappointed with my experience.  Try another hotel in the area.  My other friends stayed at the Hyatt Zilaria about (1-2) blocks away, and I believe they had a much better experience there.",6XwhYkbgsPZNQLLvTWIc3Q

Once we did get a table, the waitress had an attitude.  Maybe she was having a bad night...who knows.  It was a busy, but just because it's busy, it doesn't mean that good customer service should be forgotten.  I believe the waitress' name was Christie (can't remember at this moment).  When we finally asked for our bill at the end, and we asked if it would be okay to split amongst us, she refused.  I thought she could have refused in a different way that was less harsh.  She avoided my question and just said in a condescending tone, ""you can write how much you want to put on each card,"" and walked away.  I felt like I was being reprimanded and I was inconveniencing her instead.  If she had just told me: So sorry, we can't split the bill - if you write down the amounts, I'll get this check processed for you as quickly as possible.

Want to top it off? I got a $17 salad with a plastic fork while I saw another person eating with a real fork.

I felt like I wasted a dish since we were starving and had already munched about half.The happy hour burger (and later the menu burger) was absolutely fantastic. The brioche buns are toasted just slightly and the beef is brilliant. There is also some sort of garlic aoili that is a winner. We liked the burger so much we got the entree size as well, fries were pretty good too but nothing special. The duck dish we got was also good but not great. By the time it got to us it was a bit cold which I had read about in the reviews but didn't really believe a restaurant that is all about meat would do. They did.Lastly the ambiance was pretty nice.

My dog jumped over the fences and while the girl with the bright red hair told me that was happening, I wasn't told that if it continued my dog could get kicked out of the program. Nor did she mention it could happen anytime, like on a Monday, not that there isn't a long week ahead to figure out something for my dog to do while I'm at work. Facility is nice but for their rates it could be nicer. They don't have much space for your dogs food but you can leave a couple days food for your pup. It's $640 for 20 days which includes no walks but you can get 15 minute walks for $8. Most of the staff are great and it doesn't feel 100% right to leave a one star but getting dropped without warning on the first day of the week earns a one star review.Update: I got a very nice call from someone at Citydog which made me feel slightly better about a terrible situation. I think the people running this place do care about making good experiences but I don't think it's been figured out for larger breeds yet. Other people at my company said they had large breeds that were dropped from Citydog without notice as well.",zMKWSl7SxxPW3nidytb91g

Over one of the big 3 sports playoffs!? I mean you have 4 TVs touching one another and they all show UFC and you can't accomodate a customer who wants basketball? Not really a sports bar then, more of a single sport type bar.Probably a good spot to watch boxing or a good spot to watch other sports when boxing is not on otherwise. Good beers and lots of screens. I'm giving 2 stars because of terrible service.",zMKWSl7SxxPW3nidytb91g

Unfortunately, the restaurant did not nearly live up to expectations. First, the good stuff: The staff was extremely friendly, and the space was nice, warm, and inviting. But, the bad stuff: For appetizers, we ordered the roasted Brussels sprouts and a house salad. The salad was way too vinegary. In fact, that was the only flavor we got out of it -- it was that kind of harsh vinegary flavor that actually hurts your mouth. (The Brussels sprouts, however, were good - nicely cooked and delicious.) For entrees we ordered the lamb loin and pork cheeks etouffee (a special). The lamb was overcooked and a bit dry (when asked how we wanted it prepared, we said ""however the chef recommends it,"" so maybe he likes it on the well done side?). The pork cheeks were unbearably salty. And I'm a salt lover. In fact, we couldn't finish it, and we were so waterlogged that night that it was difficult to get our rings off. It's possible we experienced a bad night, but when three out of four dishes are bad, it's hard to imagine this doesn't happen often.",1SVDSLiWxbWmBjenfDQkbA
