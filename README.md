# anti-recommender
I often have to decide not where I really want to eat but filter places where I defenitelly don't want to go.
So I want to create something that filter this places for me automatically

## base model

minimum result create model that perform better than just predict all that worse 3.5 is bad , all is more than 3.5 is good

## plans

I plan to train model on part of Yelp academic dataset, validate on other part of Academic dataset , 
and finally validate on some scraped data
