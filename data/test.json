We spent three nights in Winthrop and came here every night. On the last night, we brought four friends along. Over the course of that time, we tried probably 8 or 9 of the cocktails on the menu (by sharing and sipping each others' drinks). And all of them were spot on. There are so many bad cocktails out there, but this place gets it right every time. In fact, the Greenbelt (tequila, jalape\u00f1o, cilantro, mint, chartreuse, falernum, lime and pineapple) might be my favorite drink of all time. We also had dinner with our drinks one night -- \u00a0a nice Thai sausage salad, and probably the best reuben we've ever had. If we lived in Winthrop (or nearby), we'd be here every week.

Unfortunately, the restaurant did not nearly live up to expectations. First, the good stuff: The staff was extremely friendly, and the space was nice, warm, and inviting. But, the bad stuff: For appetizers, we ordered the roasted Brussels sprouts and a house salad. The salad was way too vinegary. In fact, that was the only flavor we got out of it -- it was that kind of harsh vinegary flavor that actually hurts your mouth. (The Brussels sprouts, however, were good - nicely cooked and delicious.) For entrees we ordered the lamb loin and pork cheeks etouffee (a special). The lamb was overcooked and a bit dry (when asked how we wanted it prepared, we said \"however the chef recommends it,\" so maybe he likes it on the well done side?). The pork cheeks were unbearably salty. And I'm a salt lover. In fact, we couldn't finish it, and we were so waterlogged that night that it was difficult to get our rings off. It's possible we experienced a bad night, but when three out of four dishes are bad, it's hard to imagine this doesn't happen often.", "category": "\nAmerican (New)\n", "date": "9/26/2016", "alias": "arrowleaf-bistro-winthrop", "user_id": "1SVDSLiWxbWmBjenfDQkbA", "biz_id": "1SVDSLiWxbWmBjenfDQkbA"}, {"id": "vDRQtxN3pjQbNs9DmihD0w", "rating": "5.0", "text": "I love this little neighborhood restaurant! We've been going off and on since it opened, and I love that they change up the menu periodically so there's always something new to try. I'd say the menu is NW but with a big Asian tilt to it. I love the pork and kimchi dish, which I think is a staple there. Also, their rice chips are surprisingly addictive -- especially for scooping up the extra steak tartare (which is also phenomenal)! They also have a nice selection of delicious vegetable dishes and salads (although not all of them are vegetarian). They once had a smoky potato salad on the menu that I still dream about a year later. Most of the portions are pretty generous, and the wait staff is good helping you plan out a filling meal without overdoing it. The space is casual and comfortable, although it can be loud when it's full. But that's all part of the energy! If you want a quieter or romantic experience, sit in the gorgeous garden (warm weather only) or the new back room they built off the garden. This is definitely a Seattle favorite for us...", "category": "\nAmerican (New),\n                    Breakfast & Brunch,\n                    Cocktail Bars\n", "date": "4/14/2016", "alias": "brimmer-and-heeltap-seattle", "user_id": "1SVDSLiWxbWmBjenfDQkbA", "biz_id": "1SVDSLiWxbWmBjenfDQkbA"}, {"id": "-wClzbFSxWmiTnt9-C-kuw", "rating": "5.0", "text": "Heidi is fantastic! I had high expectations of her after reading all of the good reviews here and somehow she managed to exceed those expectations. Here is a breakdown of her services and why I feel so great about recommending her: Response time: \u00a0I sent Heidi an email with a detailed list of what I was looking for (a year-old van to be used as a work van). She called me within hours to discuss my email. \u00a0I wasn't expecting a call for a day or two, since I had sent an email and not left a voicemail. Knowledge: Heidi knows so many things that I would have no way of knowing, such as dealer incentives, availability and demand. Recommendations: \u00a0I asked for a year-old van, and Heidi was more than happy to find one for me. But she also gave me the option of spending a little (really, very little) more and getting a brand new van fully under warranty. \u00a0She explained that the van model I was looking for (Dodge Grand Caravan) is a favorite of rental agencies, therefore most of the used vans out there were former rental cars (something I did not like). \u00a0After telling her that I was open to the idea of a new van, she had a quote to me the next day, and she was absolutely right - it was scarcely more expensive than the used rental agency vans. Connections: \u00a0She clearly has lots of connections in the industry. \u00a0I could never shop a vehicle the way she can shop a vehicle, even if I had the time and desire. Timing from start to finish: \u00a0From the time I sent Heidi my initial email to the time I had my new car was under a week. \u00a0Incredible! Conclusion: \u00a0I ended up with a better van than I expected to get for virtually the same amount of money I was expecting to spend. My invested time was minimal and it was the easiest and smoothest transaction I've ever had with a vehicle. I will use Heidi again and again. There aren't many services like hers out there in any industry, much less in the auto-buying industry. And did I mention that she has a wonderful, upbeat personality? She is not only efficient, but she is an absolute joy as well.", "category": "\nCar Dealers\n", "date": "4/14/2014", "alias": "amazing-autowoman-bellevue", "user_id": "1SVDSLiWxbWmBjenfDQkbA", "biz_id": "1SVDSLiWxbWmBjenfDQkbA"}]
