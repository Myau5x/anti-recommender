I could tweet all day and get very little response to anything aside from a couple loyal folks on there. And it was one such reader that led me to Delmonico recently for what he claimed to be an excellent burger. He's a food writer in town so he should know what he's talking about, right?\\n\\nDelmonico is located in the small restaurant row of the Venetian right by another great burger spot, although most people would not come here for their burger. The interior is nothing too fancy in either the bar area or more traditional area in the back. I did notice while sitting at the bar that they have an amazing bourbon selection, but since I was there during a lunch break I'll have to go back some time when I'm not on the clock. The lunch and dinner menus are a bit different, with the lunch menu featuring more sandwiches and things, so maybe the comment I just made about people not coming for a burger is wrong. Either way, this restaurant is pretty fancy and features quite a number of great sounding items aside from what I came there for.\\n\\nThe Delmonico Prime Hamburger comes on a toasted brioche roll with fries, cheddar cheese and bacon. The meat had excellent flavor from the first bite, but I noticed right away that it was way overcooked and dry. It started off extremely juicy but that faded way too fast and by the end it was very dry. The cheese was melted and had great flavor, but the bun was a tiny bit dry as well and a little too thick. The heirloom tomatoes were fantastic, but maybe a bit off-putting at first due to their green color. The bacon also had good flavor, but was a tiny bit undercooked and soggy in parts. Overall it was still decent, but could have been well beyond that if the meat had been cooked properly.\\n\\nLuckily the fries were great. Some of them were almost a bit too hard and crunchy, but they were very tasty and a welcome change to the 'typical' fries I often get around town. Something I found to be quite funny was when I asked for ketchup I was brought an insanely large bowl of it, more than probably a table full of people could have used.\\n\\nThe online menu lists the burger at $15, so I was a little surprised to see the $18 listed on the menu when I made my order. I think if it was cooked properly I would still be ok with this price given the chef, the location, etc, but because of this price I seriously frown on the fact that they couldn't cook my burger properly. If you're willing to risk this inconsistency and are ok with the cost, I think it's a good burger to check out, and has the potential to be really great, but if you're at the Venetian and are craving a guaranteed good burger for a similar cost I suggest you go next door.\", useful=2, user_id='0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw', rating=4.0, token=['feel', 'like', 'twitter', 'pretti', 'useless', 'far', 'ok', 'amount', 'follow', 'guess', 'feel', 'like', 'follow', 'mani', 'peopl', 'anyth', 'say', 'get', 'lost', 'mess', 'feed', 'could', 'tweet', 'day', 'get', 'littl', 'respons', 'anyth', 'asid', 'coupl', 'loyal', 'folk', 'one', 'reader', 'led', 'delmonico', 'recent', 'claim', 'excel', 'burger', 'food', 'writer', 'town', 'know', 'talk', 'right', 'delmonico', 'locat', 'small', 'restaur', 'row', 'venetian', 'right', 'anoth', 'great', 'burger', 'spot', 'although', 'peopl', 'would', 'come', 'burger', 'interior', 'noth', 'fanci', 'either', 'bar', 'area', 'tradit', 'area', 'back', 'notic', 'sit', 'bar', 'amaz', 'bourbon', 'select', 'sinc', 'lunch', 'break', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'clock', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'menu', 'bit', 'differ', 'lunch', 'menu', 'featur', 'sandwich', 'thing', 'mayb', 'comment', 'made', 'peopl', 'come', 'burger', 'wrong', 'either', 'way', 'restaur', 'pretti', 'fanci', 'featur', 'quit', 'number', 'great', 'sound', 'item', 'asid', 'came', 'delmonico', 'prime', 'hamburg', 'come', 'toast', 'brioch', 'roll', 'fri', 'cheddar', 'chees', 'bacon', 'meat', 'excel', 'flavor', 'first', 'bite', 'notic', 'right', 'away', 'way', 'overcook', 'dri', 'start', 'extrem', 'juici', 'fade', 'way', 'fast', 'end', 'dri', 'chees', 'melt', 'great', 'flavor', 'bun', 'tini', 'bit', 'dri', 'well', 'littl', 'thick', 'heirloom', 'tomato', 'fantast', 'mayb', 'bit', 'put', 'first', 'due', 'green', 'color', 'bacon', 'also', 'good', 'flavor', 'tini', 'bit', 'undercook', 'soggi', 'part', 'overal', 'still', 'decent', 'could', 'well', 'beyond', 'meat', 'cook', 'properli', 'luckili', 'fri', 'great', 'almost', 'bit', 'hard', 'crunchi', 'tasti', 'welcom', 'chang', 'typic', 'fri', 'often', 'get', 'around', 'town', 'someth', 'found', 'quit', 'funni', 'ask', 'ketchup', 'brought', 'insan', 'larg', 'bowl', 'probabl', 'tabl', 'full', 'peopl', 'could', 'use', 'onlin', 'menu', 'list', 'burger', 'littl', 'surpris', 'see', 'list', 'menu', 'made', 'order', 'think', 'cook', 'properli', 'would', 'still', 'ok', 'price', 'given', 'chef', 'locat', 'etc', 'price', 'serious', 'frown', 'fact', 'cook', 'burger', 'properli', 'will', 'risk', 'inconsist', 'ok', 'cost', 'think', 'good', 'burger', 'check', 'potenti', 'realli', 'great', 'venetian', 'crave', 'guarante', 'good', 'burger', 'similar', 'cost', 'suggest', 'go', 'next', 'door'])"

      "The restaurant setting is unique in its cozy ambiance, but you pay $250 for two to eat good food not the ambiance. Our 30th anniversary, as a visitor to Phoenix, was not something to be stamped out in our culinary diary as \"outstanding\". The staff has been trained to \"sell\" the \"Goods\", but the Goods' are not there to be sold. Upon our arrival, we were given the privilege of being seated in the patio area, provided we vacated the table in \"one hour forty minutes\"!! Our server was very accommodating, well informed and courteous, but the kitchen did not take any notice of his recommendations and most of our food had to be returned for revision. The menu is structured around the fancy names, extravagant ingredients and presentation, but the quality and the \"yummy factor\" is just not there to match the intentions. My wife's orders had to be modified due to her numerous allegories, so in the spirit of fairness, I will only comment on my choices which were presented exactly as described on the menu. The lobster appetizer starter, with a fancy name ($18) turned out to be a few pieces of tasteless lobster meat in some kind of equally tasteless sauce buried in an unimpressive French Bread and accompanied with soggy and limp French Fries. The main course, the stake ($38+) was a lump of un-seasoned meat on a pile of fiery hot chilies and corn (out of a can), with a failed attempt to camouflage the tasteless meat. The reprieve came at the end of the meal. The desert and espresso was well presented and very tasty. \n",

Unfortunately the uni tasted like rancid iodine...if iodine could somehow spoil.  In the entire collective memory of everyone who knows my boyfriend, he has never sent a dish of food back.

My boyfriend's mention of living in Japan and eating it often did nothing to shake his confidence.  He proceeded to mention that this was uni from BC, not the Chilean uni they had been serving before, and we might be unaccustomed to its taste.

I did notice while sitting at the bar that they have an amazing bourbon selection, but since I was there during a lunch break I'll have to go back some time when I'm not on the clock. The lunch and dinner menus are a bit different, with the lunch menu featuring more sandwiches and things, so maybe the comment I just made about people not coming for a burger is wrong. Either way, this restaurant is pretty fancy and features quite a number of great sounding items aside from what I came there for.\n",

The meat had excellent flavor from the first bite, but I noticed right away that it was way overcooked and dry. It started off extremely juicy but that faded way too fast and by the end it was very dry. The cheese was melted and had great flavor, but the bun was a tiny bit dry as well and a little too thick. The heirloom tomatoes were fantastic, but maybe a bit off-putting at first due to their green color. The bacon also had good flavor, but was a tiny bit undercooked and soggy in parts. Overall it was still decent, but could have been well beyond that if the meat had been cooked properly.\n",

I think if it was cooked properly I would still be ok with this price given the chef, the location, etc, but because of this price I seriously frown on the fact that they couldn't cook my burger properly. If you're willing to risk this inconsistency and are ok with the cost, I think it's a good burger to check out, and has the potential to be really great, but if you're at the Venetian and are craving a guaranteed good burger for a similar cost I suggest you go next door.\n",

(Our server actually argued with me about my request stating that being seated is not a guarantee of fast service.) The beef brisket biscuits and gravy we ordered was actually sausage gravy, and the truffle French toast with asparagus and fried egg was good but not great.
